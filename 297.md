# Protocol assumes that chainlink will return prices with 8 decimals

## Summary
Protocol assumes that chainlink will return prices with 8 decimals

## Vulnerability Detail
The createActionInfo() function wrongly assumes that the decimal places of tokens will always be 8
```solidity
function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
        ActionInfo memory rebalanceInfo;

        // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
        // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals.
        // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)

```
But this assumption is incorrect because some feeds can have more decimals. For example ampl

If the borrowed token has more decimals than the collateral, then this will result in a revert in _calculateCurrentLeverageRatio
```solidity
return _collateralValue.preciseDiv(_collateralValue.sub(_borrowValue));
```
The calculation of the current leverage ratio is used in most crucial functions such as disengage, ripcord, iterateRebalance, and rebalance

## Impact
With certain tokens, AaveLeverageStrategyExtension may not work correctly. Additionally, inaccessible ripcord, iterateRebalance, and rebalance functions can potentially result in the liquidation of positions

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider normalizing collateralValue and borrowValue to 18 decimals before using them in the formula.
