# Airdropped Module is incompatible with Aave V3 with certain ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Airdropped tokens could be incompatible with AaveV3 with certain ERC20 tokens 


## Vulnerability Detail

The airdrop module allows a manger and any approved to absorb airdropped tokens into a token's position. However if that position is an AaveV3 position, then it will not be compatible with certain ERC20 tokens in mainnet and other L2 chains. For example, A product could have an airdrop token of EURS which is available on Aave L2 markets, but not on the mainnet market

## Impact

If a ERC20 token in an airdropped module is incompatible with AaveV3, then the tokens cannot be absorbed into the position

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If a set token's position is an external Aave V3 position, have a white list of tokens that the protocol can confirm is compatible with AaveV3
