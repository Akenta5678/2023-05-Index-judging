# XO-Unauthorized Access in isAllowedCaller Function

## Summary
- The `isAllowedCaller` function does not check the `callAllowList` mapping if the `anyoneCallable` variable is set to `true.` This  can allows anyone to call the function, even if they are not authorized to do so.
## Vulnerability Detail
 ```solidity

    /**
     * Determine if passed address is allowed to call function. If anyoneCallable set to true anyone can call otherwise needs to be approved.
     *
     * return bool Boolean indicating if allowed caller
     */
    function isAllowedCaller(address _caller) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
        return anyoneCallable || callAllowList[_caller];
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the `isAllowedCaller` function,  so the `anyoneCallable` variable is a boolean value that indicates whether anyone can call the function. If` anyoneCallable` is true, then any address can call the function, even if it is not in the `callAllowList` mapping, The problem  is that the` callAllowList` mapping is only checked if `anyoneCallable` is false. this means that if `anyoneCallable` is true, then the function will always return true, regardless of whether the address is in the `callAllowList` mapping, this vulnerability allow an attacker to steal funds or data from the contract.

## Impact
- An attacker can steal funds or data from the contract if exploit this vulnerability.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- change the `isAllowedCaller` function so that it checks the `callAllowList` mapping regardless of the value of the `anyoneCallable` variable.
