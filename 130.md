# The function "validateminimumunderlyingreceived" will consistently revert  when attempting to verify the minimum underlying received during the process of removing liquidity for a single assets.

## Summary

To check that minimum underlying is received , the function _removeliquiditysingleassset_ calls the function _validateminimumunderlyingreceived_  which ensures that the underlying balance is greater than or equal to (action info ) total notional components  +  ( action info ) _preactionactioncomponentbalances_ . However this check only works when removing liquidity for various components and not single assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

            require(
                underlyingBalance >= _actionInfo.totalNotionalComponents[i].add(_actionInfo.preActionComponentBalances[i]),
                "Underlying tokens received must be greater than minimum specified"
            );
        }
    }

This check will always fail when called by the function _removeliquiditysingleasset_  since the total notional components will be  zero for single assets and further the _preactioncomponentbalance_ is never checked in _getactioninfosingleasset_ function which is also called  by _removeliquiditysingleasset_. 

## Impact

It will be impossible to remove liquidity for single assets since function  _validateminimumunderlyingreceived_  will always revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding an if statement in the function _validateminimumunderlyingreceived_ to check the function calling it whether it is remove liquidity or remove liquidity single asset . then add a call in the function _getactioninfosingleasset_  to get the _preactioncomponentbalance_ by calling the function _getTokenbalances_.
