# `mutualUpgrade()` modifier can be bypass

## Summary

`MutualUpgrade.sol` we have modifier `mutualUpgrade()`:
```solidity
modifier mutualUpgrade(address _signerOne, address _signerTwo) { 
        require(
            msg.sender == _signerOne || msg.sender == _signerTwo,
            "Must be authorized address"
        );

        address nonCaller = _getNonCaller(_signerOne, _signerTwo);

        // The upgrade hash is defined by the hash of the transaction call data and sender of msg,
        // which uniquely identifies the function, arguments, and sender.
        bytes32 expectedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.data, nonCaller));

        if (!mutualUpgrades[expectedHash]) {
            bytes32 newHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.data, msg.sender));
            mutualUpgrades[newHash] = true;
            emit MutualUpgradeRegistered(newHash);
            return;
        }

        delete mutualUpgrades[expectedHash];

        // Run the rest of the upgrades
        _;
    }
```
This modifier is very important for the protocol and is used in `StreamingFeeSplitExtension.sol` and `BaseManagerV2.sol` contracts which are in audit scope. 

It is used to ensure that it will be called necessarily by two signers (`_signerOne`, `_signerTwo`) and requires the mutual agreement of both before proceeding to action.

## Vulnerability Detail

The modifier can be completely bypassed because didn't check if the same signer from calling the function twice consecutively.

- The first call from the signer will create a hash using the `msg.data` and the address of the other signer (`nonCaller`). This hash will be used as a key to set a flag in the `mutualUpgrades` mapping.
- Now, if the same signer makes the exact same call again, the system will again create the same hash as in the first call because the `msg.data` is the same (same function and parameters) and the `nonCaller` is the same. The system will see that the flag is already set in the `mutualUpgrades` mapping for this hash and will proceed to the deletion of the flag in `mutualUpgrades` mapping and execution of the code denoted by `_`.

This is a serious vulnerability. One signer can execute actions without the consent of the other, defeating the purpose of the two-signer control mechanism.

## Impact

The requirement of having two different signers approve an action is effectively bypassed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

You could implement a mechanism to store and check the address of the signer who initiated each action. For example, you could use an additional mapping to store the initiator's address for each action. Before an action is performed, you could check that the initiator is not the same as the current caller.
