# Manager/Users would not be able to withdraw rewards from Comptroller

## Summary:Rewards accrued by the setToken cannot be claimed .

## Vulnerability Detail:In the contract ClaimModule, the function claim() which is used to claim ctokens accrued over time by supplying to the protocol. A call to the claim() goes like this:claim()==>_claim()==>Adapter.getClaimedData, when a call is made to the claim contract either by the manager/users passing in the (setToken instance,address of reward Pool, and string Adapters Name) it forwards the call  to an internal function _claim() which does some check and utilizes another contract to prepare data, the bug is spotted when preparing the data ,
bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSignature("claimComp(address)", _setToken)

the claimComp function takes in an address as input,but passed as an input is an instance of _setToken rather than address of the setToken.This would obviously revert since it is a mismatched data type case.

## Impact:The rewards for all setTokens that has rewards in the pool would be forever stuck in the contract

## Code Snippet:
unction getClaimCallData(ISetToken _setToken, address /* _rewardPool */) external view returns (address, uint256, bytes memory) {
        bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSignature("claimComp(address)", _setToken);// (address(_setToken))
        //_setToken is not an address 

        return (address(comptroller), 0, callData);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation:Change from _setToken to address(_setToken)
