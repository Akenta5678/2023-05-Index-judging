# XO-`Resource ID`  mapping not updated after removal

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in the `addResource` function, the function does not update the `resourceId` mapping to reflect the removal of the resource. This means that the` resourceId` mapping will still contain the `ID` of the removed resource, his would cause the new resource to overwrite the old resource.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  */
unction addResource(address _resource, uint256 _id) external onlyInitialized onlyOwner {
        require(!isResource[_resource], "Resource already exists");

        require(resourceId[_id] == address(0), "Resource ID already exists");

        isResource[_resource] = true;

        resourceId[_id] = _resource;

        resources.push(_resource);

        emit ResourceAdded(_resource, _id);
    }

    /**
     * PRIVILEGED GOVERNANCE FUNCTION. Allows governance to remove a resource
     *
     * @param _id               ID of the resource contract to remove
     */
    function removeResource(uint256 _id) external onlyInitialized onlyOwner {
        address resourceToRemove = resourceId[_id];

        require(resourceToRemove != address(0), "Resource does not exist");

        resources = resources.remove(resourceToRemove);

        delete resourceId[_id];

        isResource[resourceToRemove] = false;

        emit ResourceRemoved(resourceToRemove, _id);
    }

```
- There is a vulnerability  in the `addResource` function, is that the `resourceId` `mapping` is never updated to reflect the removal of a resource  means that if a resource is removed, its `ID` will still be in the `mapping`, and it will be possible to add a new `resource` with the same `ID`. This could lead to confusion and errors, and  the` removeResource` function removes the resource from the resources array and the `isResource` `mapping`, it does not update the `resourceId` `mapping`. means that the `resourceId` `mapping` will still contain the `ID` of the removed resource.
## Impact
- This could lead to confusion and errors

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `removeResource` function should also update the `resourceId` mapping.
