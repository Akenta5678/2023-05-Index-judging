# XO- Vulnerability in `interactManager` Function leading to Reentrancy attack

## Summary
- there is a vulnerability in the `BaseManager.sol` contract, specially in ` interactManager` function that is leading to `reentrancy `attack. this function is used by adapters to interact with the `SetToken` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 */
    function interactManager(address _module, bytes calldata _data) external onlyAdapter {
        // Invoke call to module, assume value will always be 0
        _module.functionCallWithValue(_data, 0);
    }

    /**
```
- There is a vulnerability in the `interactManager` function, this function is used by adapters to interact with the `SetToken` contract. The function are takes two arguments, ` _module` is the address of the module contract and `_data` it is  the data to be passed to the module contract, and this function works by calling the` functionCallWithValue` function on the module contract. this function sends a `transaction` to the module contract and waits for the `transaction` to be mined, a,d the probem here is that the `functionCallWithValue` function is vulnerable to a `reentrancy` attack. that can an attacker can call a function recursively before the function has finished executing. This can allow the attacker to drain the contract's funds, and in the i`nteractManager` function, the `functionCallWithValue` function is called without any `safeguards` to prevent a `reentrancy` attack. This means that an attacker could call the `interactManager` function and then call the `functionCallWithValue` function recursively. This would allow the attacker to drain the `SetToken` contract's funds.
## Impact
- An attacker allow to drain the contract's funds.
- How an attacker can use this vulnerability.
    - An attacker creates a new contract that inherits from the `IAdapter` interface.
    - The attacker calls the `addAdapter` function on the `SetToken` contract to add the new contract as an adapter.
    - The attacker then calls the` interactManager` function on the `SetToken` contract to interact with the module contract.
    - The module contract calls back to the` interactManage`r function on the `SetToken` contract.
    - The attacker exploits the `reentrancy` vulnerability to drain the `SetToken` contract's funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  the `interactManager` function should be made `constant`. This will prevent the function from being called from other contracts. and, the `functionCallWithValue` function should be `updated` to include `safeguards` to prevent a `reentrancy attack`.
