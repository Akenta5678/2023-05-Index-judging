# feeRecipient lack of zero address check

## Summary
we identified a potential security issue related to the lack of a zero address check in the constructor function. This vulnerability could lead to unintended consequences and potential security breaches
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/Controller.sol#L103#L105
`_feeRecipient` lack of zero address check
## Impact
In the constructor function of the smart contract, the provided code snippet lacks a check to ensure that the _feeRecipient parameter is not a zero address (0x0). Failing to validate the input address increases the risk of unexpected behavior and potential attacks.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    constructor(address _feeRecipient) public {
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient; //@audit lack of a zero address check.
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a zero address check
```solidity
constructor(address _feeRecipient) public {
    require(_feeRecipient != address(0), "Invalid fee recipient address");
    feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
}

```
