# Missing onlyOperator modifier on transferTokens()

## Summary
The function transferTokens() is missing the `onlyOperator` modifier. As per the comments, this should be OPERATOR ONLY.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the comment on [line 310](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L310), the function `transferTokens()` should be OPERATOR ONLY
> * OPERATOR ONLY: Transfers _tokens held by the manager to _destination.

However, the `onlyOperator` modifier is missing from this function 

In all of the other functions, for instance, [addModule()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L323-L327), [removeModule()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L332-L337), [emergencyRemoveProtectedModule()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L356) etc. - the natspec mentioned these to be OPERATOR ONLY, and they correctly have the `onlyOperator` modifier set.

## Impact
transferTokens() is missing the `onlyOperator` modifier. Since this function transfers `_tokens` held by the manager to `_destination`, and can be used to recover anything sent here - proper checks as mentioned in the natspec, must be maintained

```solidity
function transferTokens(address _token, address _destination, uint256 _amount) external onlyExtension {
```
