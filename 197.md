# XO-Unused Gas Parameter in SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom Function

## Summary
- There is a vulnerability in the ` SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function. The `safeTransferFrom` function takes a third parameter, which is the `gas` that should be used for the `transfer`, the `gas` parameter is not being used in the code. This means that the `transfer` could fail if the `gas` provided by the caller is not enough.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        IERC20 _token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _quantity
    )
        internal
    {
        // Call specified ERC20 contract to transfer tokens (via proxy).
        if (_quantity > 0) {
            uint256 existingBalance = _token.balanceOf(_to);

            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                _token,
                _from,
                _to,
                _quantity
            );

            uint256 newBalance = _token.balanceOf(_to);

            // Verify transfer quantity is reflected in balance
            require(
                newBalance == existingBalance.add(_quantity),
                "Invalid post transfer balance"
            );
        }
    }
}
```
- In the `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function, the `gas` parameter is included but not utilized within the code. This means that regardless of the `gas` value provided by the `caller`, the `transfer` will use the default `amount` of `gas`. If the default `gas` is not sufficient to complete the `transfer`, the `transaction` may fail, resulting in an incomplete `transfer` or an erroneous state.
## Impact
- If the transfer fails, the user may lose the tokens that they were trying to transfer.
-  an attacker could exploit this vulnerability in the contract and can lead to loss of funds or other damage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function should be called with a `gas` parameter.
- fixing code :
```solidity
function transferFrom(
        IERC20 _token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _quantity,
        uint256 _gas
    )
        internal
    {
        // Call specified ERC20 contract to transfer tokens (via proxy).
        if (_quantity > 0) {
            // Get the balance of the `_to` address before the transfer.
            uint256 existingBalance = _token.balanceOf(_to);

            // Transfer tokens from the `_from` address to the `_to` address.
            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                _token,
                _from,
                _to,
                _quantity,
                _gas
            );

            // Get the balance of the `_to` address after the transfer.
            uint256 newBalance = _token.balanceOf(_to);

            // Verify that the balance has increased by the quantity transferred.
            require(
                newBalance == existingBalance.add(_quantity),
                "Invalid post transfer balance"
            );
        }
    }
