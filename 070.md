# Absorb() and batchAbsorb() functions doesn't check the `anyoneAbsorb` bool which is set in the AirdropSettings by the setManager indicating if any address can call absorb or just the manager

## Summary
Absorb() and batchAbsorb() function doesn't check the `anyoneAbsorb` bool which is set in the AirdropSettings indicating if any address can call absorb or just the manager

## Vulnerability Detail
the `anyoneAbsorb` bool here in AirdropSettings is neglected by Absorb() and batchAbsorb() functions
```solidity
 struct AirdropSettings {
        address[] airdrops;                    
        address feeRecipient;                  
        uint256 airdropFee;                    
        bool anyoneAbsorb;        // Boolean indicating if any address can call absorb or just the manager
    }
```

the `anyoneAbsorb` bool when set to false by the setManager means the manager doesn't want any address to be able to call absorb but only himself(the set manager)
and when it is set to true anyone can then absorb.

but the Absorb() and batchAbsorb() functions neglect it.

## Impact
Any address can call absorb() and batchAbsorb() functions even when the setManager sets the `anyoneAbsorb` bool in the AirdropSettings to false because the Absorb() and batchAbsorb() functions neglect the boolean value of `anyoneAbsorb`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a modifier probably named `anyoneAbsorb` which will be placed on the absorb() and batchAbsorb() functions.
The anyoneAbsorb modifier will be updated in the initialize() function by updating it with AirdropSettings' `anyoneAbsorb` bool
The modifier should be built with a require statement to ensure a revert when necessary
