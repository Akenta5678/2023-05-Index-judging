# Collateral and debt positions are not updated after issue and redeem of set token

## Summary
The last steps in `DebtIssuanceModule` and `DebtIssuanceModuleV2` are resolving debts, equity and fees. resolving debts and equities would call `componentIssueHook` and `componentRedeemHook` from `AaveV3LeverageModule` if it was registered. `componentIssueHook` and `componentRedeemHook` call `_borrow` and `_repayBorrow` respectively which would `increase` and `decrease` debt token respectively. Unlike lever and delever, they don't update external positions. Nor update default position from changes in aToken balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
primary position and external position are not updated after token issuance or redemption.

## Impact
* positionMultiplier cannot be updated
* position would not be removed if newUnit is 0
* get methods for position would return wrong value to initialized modules such as amm, airdrop, trade, and wrap. And depending on configuration, access control and transaction order, this could be devastating or annoying.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update collateral and debt position in component hooks. This could be as simple as calling `sync` again or `_updateCollateralPosition` and `_updateBorrowPosition` for better efficiency.
