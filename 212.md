# Operator can drain tokens from BaseManagerV2

## Summary
The BaseManagerV2 contract ought to be used to collect the fee. Based on the `transferTokens` [docs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L312), `In BaseManagerV2, extensions should be the only contracts designated as feeRecipient in fee modules.` and it has as onlyExtension modifier.

Note: this report assumes `OPERATOR ONLY` is a mistake in the docs and ought to be `ADAPTER ONLY`. If transferTokens is meant to be `OPERATOR ONLY`, then correct the modifier to be `onlyOperator` rather than `onlyExtension`.

## Vulnerability Detail
onlyExtension modifier would pass if operator creates a new smart contract called EvilExtension with the following properties
* manager() which returns the BaseManagerV2 contract address
* execute() which calls manager.transferTokens(). PS: it can be protected by require(owner == operatorAddress)

## Impact
Operator controls funds in BaseManagerV2 including fees sent to the contract.
