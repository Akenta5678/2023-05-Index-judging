# LastTradeTimestamp value for exchange is not updated in the disengage function.

## Summary
The [globalLastTradeTimestamp and exchangeLastTradeTimestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1207) values don't update in the [disengage ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L412)function.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
     function _updateLastTradeTimestamp(string memory _exchangeName) internal {
        globalLastTradeTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].exchangeLastTradeTimestamp = block.timestamp;
     }

```
This function updates both the exchange-specific and global timestamp so that the epoch rebalance can use the global timestamp (since the global timestamp is always equal to the most recently used exchange timestamp). This allows for multiple rebalances to occur simultaneously since only the exchange-specific timestamp is checked for non-epoch rebalances.

Before any trade execution, this function gets called in ripcord, iterateRebalance, rebalance and engage functions to update both the exchange-specific and global timestamp.

But in the [disengage ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L412)function, trade execution get done without update LastTradeTimestamp for the exchange-specific and global timestamp.

**What this means for investors: the TWAP Cooldown Period allows time for the relevant liquidity pools that the FLI contracts trade against during rebalancing to absorb the most recent rebalance transaction before submitting a subsequent one. Allowing the liquidity pool to rebalance after each trade shields FLI products from unfavorable slippage, minimizing operational costs and preserving AUM.**
