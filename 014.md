# _transferEtherRewardToCaller() may be fails because no payable keyword while sending ETHER.

## Summary
According to solidity [docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/080-breaking-changes.html#new-restrictions) " compiler cannot determine whether or not these addresses are payable or not, so it now requires an explicit conversion to make this requirement visible. The global variables tx.origin and msg.sender have the type address instead of address payable. One can convert them into address payable by using an explicit conversion, i.e., payable(tx.origin) or payable(msg.sender)." . Before sending the ether to EOA(External Owned Account) like **payable(0xdCad3a6d3569DF655070DEd06cb7A1b2Ccd1D3AF)**

## Vulnerability Detail
Function  [ripcord()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L392)  transfer ether to msg.sender  by below code 
```solidity
        uint256 etherTransferred = _transferEtherRewardToCaller(incentive.etherReward);
```

In _transferEtherRewardToCaller(incentive.etherReward) function sends ether like below 
```solidity

        msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer);
```

If msg.sender is non-payable address then above both function will get fails. Even Solidity compiler cannot identify the msg.sender or tx.origin is payable or not ,it's clearly states in solidity docs.
And Above the ripcord() function clearly states that  **ONLY EOA:** and in onlyEOA modifier looks like below , no conversion to payable address .
```solidity
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
        _;
    }
```








## Impact
Sending ETHER may be failed due to non-payable External Owned Account (EOA)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Reference
Look into this blog a good example how to send ETH to EOA safely
https://solidity-by-example.org/sending-ether/

## Recommendation
Change like below
```solidity
    function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) internal returns(uint256) {
        uint256 etherToTransfer = _etherReward < address(this).balance ? _etherReward : address(this).balance;

       /*@audit change here payable*/  payable(msg.sender).transfer(etherToTransfer);

        return etherToTransfer;
    }
```

- And add payable keyword for ripcord() and _transferEtherRewardToCaller()

- Use call instead of transfer because  . 
   The use of the deprecated transfer() function for an address will inevitably 
   make the transaction fail when:

   The msg.sender or  smart contract does not implement a payable function.
   The msg.sender  does implement a payable fallback which uses 
   more than 2300 gas unit.
