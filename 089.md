# `deleverToZeroBorrowBalance()` prone to sandwich attack in case of low debt to repay

## Summary

`AaveV3LeverageModule` 's`deleverToZeroBorrowBalance()` is used to pays down the borrow asset to 0 selling off a given amount of collateral asset. However, incase of low debt to repay, this execution prone to sandwich attack when executing trade from collateral asset to repay asset.

## Vulnerability Detail

`deleverToZeroBorrowBalance()` will first withdraw the provided collateral amount from calculated from `_redeemQuantityUnits` calldata. Then trade it to repay asset, but incase of low debt left calculated from here :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveV3LeverageModule.sol#L393

```solidity
        uint256 notionalRepayQuantity = underlyingToReserveTokens[_repayAsset].variableDebtToken.balanceOf(address(_setToken));
```

The executed trade not limit and check the `notionalRedeemQuantity` that will be traded, so attacker can see this call, and if this favorable for him, he can sandwich this `deleverToZeroBorrowBalance()` call.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveV3LeverageModule.sol#L409

```solidity
        // @audit - this trade is prone to sandwich attack, due to no control of slippage between notionalRedeemQuantity and notionalRepayQuantity
        _executeTrade(deleverInfo, _collateralAsset, _repayAsset, _tradeData);
```

this trade inside delever to zero process is prone to sandwich attack, due to no control of slippage between `notionalRedeemQuantity` and `notionalRepayQuantity`


## Impact

While the extension contract do have mechanism to send `_redeemQuantityUnits` only to match the leverage equal to 1, so it will protect from sandwich attack. 

BUT this module is not exclusively enforced to work only with the Aave leverage strategy extension, any EOA manager that use this module can suffer sandwich attack due to lack of slippage  protection inside module.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Move the necessary `_redeemQuantityUnits` proper calculation from extension to this module, so the slippage protection is on module level.
