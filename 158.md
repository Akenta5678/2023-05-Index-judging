# AaveLeverageStrategyExtension: Usage of Deprecated Chainlink API puts Protocol at Risk

## Summary

The AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract uses Chainlink's deprecated `latestAnswer()` API in its `_createActionInfo()` function. This function is extensively used within the contract, including in the `engage()`, `getCurrentLeverageRatio()`, `getChunkRebalanceNotional()`, and internal `_getAndValidateLeveragedInfo()` functions. The continued use of this deprecated API could potentially lead to stale data and pose a significant risk to the overall functioning of the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_createActionInfo()` function retrieves asset prices using the deprecated `latestAnswer()` method from Chainlink oracles. As indicated by Chainlink, this method is deprecated and may stop working if Chainlink discontinues support. Furthermore, `latestAnswer()` does not have the capability to validate the freshness of the data it retrieves.

This means the function could potentially return stale or outdated price data, which could lead to incorrect calculations of collateral and borrow values in the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract. Since the `_createActionInfo()` function is extensively used within the contract, this vulnerability could impact a broad range of operations.

Take a look at [AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L884-L907](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L884-L907)

```solidity
    /**
     * Create the action info struct to be used in internal functions
     *
     * return ActionInfo                Struct containing data used by internal lever and delever functions
     */
    function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
        ActionInfo memory rebalanceInfo;

        // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
        // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals.
        // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)
        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
        int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice = rawBorrowPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.borrowDecimalAdjustment);

        rebalanceInfo.collateralBalance = strategy.targetCollateralAToken.balanceOf(address(strategy.setToken));
        rebalanceInfo.borrowBalance = strategy.targetBorrowDebtToken.balanceOf(address(strategy.setToken));
        rebalanceInfo.collateralValue = rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice.preciseMul(rebalanceInfo.collateralBalance);
        rebalanceInfo.borrowValue = rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice.preciseMul(rebalanceInfo.borrowBalance);
        rebalanceInfo.setTotalSupply = strategy.setToken.totalSupply();

        return rebalanceInfo;
    }

```

At L895 and 897 we cam see the double use of the deprecated `latestAnswer()` method.

## Impact

Continued use of deprecated APIs poses a risk of inoperability if the API is discontinued or its functionality is altered. In this case, the failure of `latestAnswer()` would affect the `_createActionInfo()` function, which is instrumental in several core functionalities of the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract.

Moreover, the lack of data freshness validation with `latestAnswer()` can lead to the retrieval of stale or outdated prices. As a result, inaccurate calculations of collateral and borrow values could occur, potentially leading to significant financial and operational issues for the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend switching from the deprecated `latestAnswer()` to the `latestRoundData()` method provided by the Chainlink V3 API. The `latestRoundData()` method provides fresh data and allows for extra validations, enhancing data reliability and accuracy.
