# No validation check on currentleverageratio being lower than the incentive leverage ratio

## Summary
No valid check on currentleverageratio being lower than the incentive leverage ratio could result in an edge case scenario where an exchange can be instantly ripcorded 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function engage, the value of current leverage ratio is 10^18 by default shown here:

However, there is no validation to check to make sure that the incentived leverage ratio is more than this 

This can result in scenarios where a module is instantly ripcorded 

## Impact
A module can be instantly ripcorded

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the constructor, add a check to make sure that the incentive leverage ratio is bigger than 10^18
