# L2 optimization functions are not used for L2 pool

## Summary

The AaveV3 library does not use the L2 optimization functions that are recommended by Aave for interacting with the L2 pool contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Aave V3, the pool contracts on L2 (Arbitrum and Optimism) introduce optimization functions that compress the information passed to the pool methods.

        The main transaction cost on L2 comes from calldata. To minimize this cost, Aave V3 uses slightly different L2 Contracts, on Arbitrum and Optimism, that compress the info passed to Pool methods.

However, the AaveV3 library does not use these optimization functions when deploying on L2. Instead, it uses the default functions in the pool contracts that take uncompressed arguments.

## Impact

Using the default functions may result in higher transaction cost on L2 and deviate from the best practice of Aave V3 recommendation.
