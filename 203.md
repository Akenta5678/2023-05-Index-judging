# Informational underscore prefix or private  and internal functions

## Summary
The project does not consistently use an underscore prefix for private  and internal functions and variables, which deviates from the recommended style guide for Solidity. Adding an underscore prefix to private functions and variables improves code readability and distinguishes them from public and external ones.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contracts does not follow the convention of using an underscore prefix for private functions and variables. This can make it more challenging to identify the visibility of functions and variables when reviewing the code, potentially leading to confusion and mistakes.

The impact of not using an underscore prefix for private functions and variables is primarily on code readability and maintainability. By not adhering to the standard convention, it may take additional effort for developers and auditors to differentiate between different visibility levels. This can lead to confusion, errors, or delays when working with the contract code.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function transferFrom(IERC20 _token, address _from, address _to, uint256 _quantity) internal {
        ExplicitERC20.transferFrom(_token, _from, _to, _quantity);
    }

    /**
     * Gets the integration for the module with the passed in name. Validates that the address is not empty
     */
    function getAndValidateAdapter(string memory _integrationName) internal view returns(address) { 
        bytes32 integrationHash = getNameHash(_integrationName);
        return getAndValidateAdapterWithHash(integrationHash);
    }

    /**
     * Gets the integration for the module with the passed in hash. Validates that the address is not empty
     */
    function getAndValidateAdapterWithHash(bytes32 _integrationHash) internal view returns(address) { 
        address adapter = controller.getIntegrationRegistry().getIntegrationAdapterWithHash(
            address(this),
            _integrationHash
        );

        require(adapter != address(0), "Must be valid adapter"); 
        return adapter;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the total fee for this module of the passed in index (fee % * quantity)
     */
    function getModuleFee(uint256 _feeIndex, uint256 _quantity) internal view returns(uint256) {
        uint256 feePercentage = controller.getModuleFee(address(this), _feeIndex);
        return _quantity.preciseMul(feePercentage);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To improve code clarity and adherence to best practices, it is recommended to add an underscore prefix to private functions and variables. This will enhance readability and make it easier to distinguish between different visibility levels.
