# Possible to redeem tokens without repaying debt.

## Summary

In the DebtIssuanceModule, users have the ability to redeem SetTokens without repaying any debt if certain conditions a met. 

The vulnerability arises when a SetToken holds debt in a token that fails silently during a standard `transferFrom()` call. In such cases, if the SetToken also employs the same token in a default position, a user can redeem their SetToken without fulfilling the debt repayment requirement. Instead, they can utilize the tokens owned by the SetToken in a default position.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens fail silently on a standard `transferFrom()`. A user could therefore pass the following code without reverting:

```solidity
                    transferFrom(
                        IERC20(component),
                        msg.sender,
                        address(_setToken),
                        componentQuantity
                    )
					_executeExternalPositionHooks(_setToken, _quantity, IERC20(component), false, false)
```

This code is used in `_resolveDebtPosition()` to transfer tokens from the user to the SetToken to repay a debt.

The `_executeExternalPositionHook()` can also be successfully passed if the SetToken uses the same token in a default position in which case those tokens will be used to repay the debt.

## Impact

A user can steal from other users since they can redeem their tokens for collateral tokens without paying any debt. The amount they are able to steal is based on how large the default position of the same token is. SetTokens can be complex and hold significant positions, this issue could lead to significant loss based on the SetToken configuration.
