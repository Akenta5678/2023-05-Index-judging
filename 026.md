# Using a deprecated Chainlink function to pull the asset's price from the Chainlink Oracle

# Medium Severity
## Title
Using a deprecated Chainlink function to pull the asset's price from the Chainlink Oracle

## Summary
The protocol uses Chainlink as the Oracle service to pull the prices of the assets (collateral & borrow).
The protocol is using a [**deprecated**](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer) function by the Oracle provider (Chainlink) [to pull the prices](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L895-L898)

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is using a [**deprecated**](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer) function by the Oracle provider (Chainlink) [to pull the prices](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L895-L898)

- According to Chainlink’s documentation [(API Reference)](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference), **the latestAnswer function is deprecated**. **This function does not throw an error if no answer has been reached, but instead returns 0**, possibly causing an incorrect price to be fed to the different price feeds or even a Denial of Service by a division by zero

- In addition to the above scenario, the fact that the deprecated functions returns a price it doesn't mean that the price is the most recent price, let's remember that Chainlink can returns stale prices, which could end up causing problems when using the returned price to compute other values. The current function in use is capable to only return the price, it doesn't return any of the other values (uint80 baseRoundID , int256 answer , , uint256 baseTimestamp ,uint80 baseAnsweredInRound) as the `latestAnswer()`.
  - Not able to prevent computing values using a stale price

## Impact
- In the scenario that the function returns 0 instead of returning the expected price, the engage() function in the `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension` would become unusable.
- The reason is that when the [engage()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L256-L292) function is in the process of [computing the max borrow, it makes a division by the value of the price pulled from the oracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1107-L1109), ***if the price returned by Chainlink was 0, the division will revert with a mathematical error, thus transactions will be reverting***

## Tool used
Manual Review & [Chainlink Documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference)

## Recommendation
- It is recommended to use [Chainlink’s latestRoundData()](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata) function to get the price instead. It is also recommended to add checks on the return data with proper revert messages if the price is stale or the round is incomplete, for example
```solidity
( uint80 baseRoundID , int256 answer , , uint256 baseTimestamp ,uint80 baseAnsweredInRound ) = assetChainlinkPriceFeed.latestAnswer();
require ( answer > 0, " ChainlinkPriceOracle : answer <= 0");
require ( baseAnsweredInRound >= baseRoundID , " ChainlinkPriceOracle :Stale price");
require ( baseTimestamp > 0, " ChainlinkPriceOracle : Round not complete");
uint256 _price = uint256 ( answer );
```
