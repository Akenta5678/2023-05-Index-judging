# removePendingModule not completely removing module

## Summary
In SetToken.removeModule it is removing all the PENDING module from the SetToken contract, which should be called by onlyOwner it does like: first it checks if is unlocked or not then it in 2nd condition it is checking if ``` _module ``` is set to ``` INITIALIZED ModuleState ``` if these both require conditions are true then it calls removeModule function on ``` _module ``` address after that it sets ``` _module ``` address to ``` NONE ModuleState ``` then it calls removerStorage function to completely remove this ``` _module ``` from the storage !! 

## Vulnerability Detail
Now the similar checks and conditions are performed under SetToken.removePendingModule but instead of checking   ``` _module ``` is set to ``` INITIALIZED ModuleState ``` it checks  ``` _module ``` is set to ``` PENDING ModuleState ``` after which it sets ``` _module ``` to ``` NONE state ``` in which the SetToken will not be able to perform any actions that require a module, and now instead of calling removeStorage to completely remove the _module after marking it to ``` NONE ``` it emits an event, due to which ``` _module ``` get remain in the storage and if a _module still remains in the contract after setting its state to NONE, then the manager could potentially misuse it by accessing the module's data or functions directly. This could allow the manager to steal tokens from the SetToken or miss-using its operations.

```
 function removePendingModule(address _module) external onlyManager {
        require(!isLocked, "Only when unlocked");
        require(moduleStates[_module] == ISetToken.ModuleState.PENDING, "Module must be pending");

        moduleStates[_module] = ISetToken.ModuleState.NONE;

        emit PendingModuleRemoved(_module);
    }
```

## Recommendation
must include a ``` modules.removeStorage(_module); ``` to completely remove it.
