# Operator can make setToken call functions not authorized by the methodologist

## Summary
The BaseManagerV2 contract is meant to decentralize power over the SetToken. Operator is meant to run daily operations while methodologist is meant to put guardrails on the operator's action. This is mentioned on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1109133391904915557/1111458670199447603) and the contract is designed that way with features like
* protected modules
* initialization required by methodologist
* mutualUpgrades for some config update

However, `_senderAuthorizedForModule` always return true for modules that are not protected.

## Vulnerability Detail
interactManager is the key point in the BaseManagerV2 contracts cause it invokes modules which in turn invoke setToken. It requires that the methodologist has signed off the protected modules which are meant to interact with the setToken by calling `authorizeInitialization`.

However, `_senderAuthorizedForModule` always return true for modules that are not protected. And this could be used by `operator` to make the setToken invoke calls that are unprecedented.

### POC
* Configuration using AAVE V3 strategy is complete and methodologist initializes BaseManagerV2
* operator creates a new smart contract called EvilExtension with the following properties
    * manager() which returns the BaseManagerV2 contract address
    * execute() which calls manager.interactManager(). PS: it can be protected by require(owner == operatorAddress)
* operator calls addExtension to add the `EvilExtension` contract
* operator calls addModule to add each module in the controller
* operator can call evilExtension.execute to invokeManager and execute whatever he wants. Example include using AAVE V2 to leverage, and any onlyManager functions on modules to his interest.

## Impact
operator controls the SetToken, rather than BaseManagerV2 contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
return false when module is not protected in [_senderAuthorizedForModule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L611)
