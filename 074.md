# AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension should check that position is not close to liquidation after emode category change

## Summary
AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension should check that position is not close to liquidation after emode category change. In case if category is changed, so LTV has decreased, then position can become close to liquidation which is dangerous.
## Vulnerability Detail
`AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension` allows to provide emode category for the `SetToken`. Currently there is no any check after the change and the call can be done any time by operator.
emode allows account to have better LTV for specific assets. For example before emode category is swithced on for you, you can have 80% and after that you can get 95% LTV. That actually means that you can borrow much more using same collateral amount.
When you change category, then aave check that account is not liquidatable after the change. But this is not enough, as `AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension` has such term as `unutilizedLeveragePercentage`, which is the collateral buffer to protect from liqudation in case of price changes.

So next situation is possible.
Suppose that emode is switched for some category, so SetToken has 95% LTV for the collateral asset. But current LTV of SetToken is 80%. Then operator calls change emode category to another one, which drops LTV for the collateral asset to 80% now and liquidation threshold is 82%, so changing category is done. The problem now is that position of SetToken is not safe now, as `unutilizedLeveragePercentage` buffer is not checked and in case of collateral/debt token price change, SetToken position can become liquidatable and holders can loose funds.
## Impact
SetToken holders can loose funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think that check should be done, that after emode category change, LTV is safe and `unutilizedLeveragePercentage` buffer is preserved.
