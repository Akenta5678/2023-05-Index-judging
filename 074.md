# Operator will not be able to call withdrawEtherBalance after disengage call, when twapLeverageRatio is not 0

## Summary
In case if `twapLeverageRatio != 0` and operator will call `disengage` in order to make full deleverage, then after that it will be not possible to withdraw ether from balance using `withdrawEtherBalance` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
In case, when it was not possible to leverage/deleverage to the target level, then target level [is set to the `twapLeverageRatio` variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1169-L1171), so later users can continue rebalancing using `iterateRebalance` function. Also `twapLeverageRatio` variable [can be deleted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1183-L1185) in this function.

In case when operator wants to repay whole loan to upgrade contract or shut down strategy, then he can call `disengage` function. After that SetToken will not have debt in aave as it will fully repay it in this function.

`AaveLeverageStrategyExtension` is going to contain ether balance, which is used to pay users for rebalancing. Operator can call `withdrawEtherBalance` function in order to withdraw funds. It is possible only when `twapLeverageRatio == 0`, as `noRebalanceInProgress` modifier is used.

So now i am ready to explain possible problem.
In case if `twapLeverageRatio != 0`(active rebalancing) an operator calls `disengage` in order to shut down strategy, then it is not possible for him to call `withdrawEtherBalance` function in order to withdraw ether from extension.
The only solution to remove `twapLeverageRatio` is to call `iterateRebalance` function. But it will fail, once whole debt is repaid. Because, [`_getAndValidateLeveragedInfo` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L339-L343) requires [that debt is not 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L867).
## Impact
It is not possible to withdraw balance from extension contract.

## Recommendation
Maybe, you need to delete `twapLeverageRatio` when debt is fully repaid.
