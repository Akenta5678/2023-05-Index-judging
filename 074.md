# Anybody can launch products on index protocol, breaking trust assumptions

## Summary

Factory is not gated and lets anybody to launch new products. This breaks trusts assumptions and Index protocol guarantees.

## Vulnerability Detail

This quote from Index Protocol docs states that:

> In contrast to Set Protocol v2, Index Protocol is not intended to be a self-service platform for third parties to launch products permissionlessly; rather, it exists to support secure and accessible structured products launched by Index Coop and its partners.

https://docs.indexcoop.com/index-coop-community-handbook/protocols/index-protocol

However, it can bee seen that this guarantee is not reflected into the contracts. Anybody can call `create()` from SetTokenCreator.sol resulting in creation of a new Set token product with the `manager` of the token being chosen by the caller.

Furthermore, it can bee seen that this newly created token gets registered in the controller as a valid Set Token and part of the System.

https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/86be7ee76d9a7e4f7e93acfc533216ebef791c89/contracts/protocol/Controller.sol#L365

These issues both invalidate the guaranties made by the index protocol in the official docs and enables scammers to disguise as official system contracts and possibly scam protocol users.

There is no way to distinguish protocol created- trusted products from third party untrusted products since the contracts store them equally and `isSystemContract()` and `isSet()` returns `true` for both.

An attacker can create a new SetToken that will be registered in the `controller.sol` as a system contract and a valid set token, then steal investors funds using the unrestricted manager rights. Since the investors are guaranteed that all the products in the protocol are launched by Index Coop and its partners, they may be easily convinced to invest in such malicious tokens.

## Impact

Broken trust assumptions and guarantees may causes malicious products to harm users of the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Require token creators to be whitelisted by the owner.
