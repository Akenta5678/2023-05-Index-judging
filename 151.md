# AaveLeverageStrategyExtension: Break of contract's logic while updating non-exchange settings

## Summary

In the [AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol) contract, there is a critical function named `_validateNonExchangeSettings()`, used for validating various methodology, execution, and incentive settings. This report entails the potential issues related to the handling of edge case scenarios due to the usage of non-strict inequalities in several requirements.

NB: The function `_validateNonExchangeSettings()` is heavily utilized in different parts of the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol contract such as `setMethodologySettings()`, `setExecutionSettings()`, `setIncentiveSettings()`, and even in the `constructor()`, exarcebating the issue

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at [\_validateNonExchangeSettings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L909-L956)

```solidity
    /**
     * Validate non-exchange settings in constructor and setters when updating.
     */
    function _validateNonExchangeSettings(
        MethodologySettings memory _methodology,
        ExecutionSettings memory _execution,
        IncentiveSettings memory _incentive
    )
        internal
        pure
    {
        require (
            _methodology.minLeverageRatio <= _methodology.targetLeverageRatio && _methodology.minLeverageRatio > 0,
            "Must be valid min leverage"
        );
        require (
            _methodology.maxLeverageRatio >= _methodology.targetLeverageRatio,
            "Must be valid max leverage"
        );
        require (
            _methodology.recenteringSpeed <= PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit() && _methodology.recenteringSpeed > 0,
            "Must be valid recentering speed"
        );
        require (
            _execution.unutilizedLeveragePercentage <= PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit(),
            "Unutilized leverage must be <100%"
        );
        require (
            _execution.slippageTolerance <= PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit(),
            "Slippage tolerance must be <100%"
        );
        require (
            _incentive.incentivizedSlippageTolerance <= PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit(),
            "Incentivized slippage tolerance must be <100%"
        );
        require (
            _incentive.incentivizedLeverageRatio >= _methodology.maxLeverageRatio,
            "Incentivized leverage ratio must be > max leverage ratio"
        );
        require (
            _methodology.rebalanceInterval >= _execution.twapCooldownPeriod,
            "Rebalance interval must be greater than TWAP cooldown period"
        );
        require (
            _execution.twapCooldownPeriod >= _incentive.incentivizedTwapCooldownPeriod,
            "TWAP cooldown must be greater than incentivized TWAP cooldown"
        );
    }
```

This function checks certain conditions which are required to hold for the system to work properly. However, in the last six `require` statements of the function, the conditions are defined with a `<=` or `>=` operator, which might lead to unintended behavior in edge case scenarios.

As an example, consider the condition ` _execution.unutilizedLeveragePercentage <= PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit()`. Here, the `unutilizedLeveragePercentage` could potentially be exactly equal to `PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit()`. In the context of the contract, this would mean that 100% of the leverage is unutilized. This is not the intended behavior, as it would mean no leverage is being utilized at all, making the leveraging mechanism meaningless.

Similar logic applies to the other conditions. In each case, the system could potentially be pushed into an extreme state if the parameters are allowed to take their maximum or minimum values.

## Impact

In edge cases, these conditions could lead to undesired system states, causing disruption in the normal operation of the contract. For instance, a 100% unutilized leverage or 100% slippage tolerance might not be the intended behavior. Also, an equal incentivized leverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio could also lead to unintended system states.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It would be advisable to adjust these conditions so that the inequality checks are strict (i.e., change `<=`/`>=` to `<`/`>`). This would prevent the system from reaching those edge states, which might cause undesired behavior.
