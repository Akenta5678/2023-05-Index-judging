# Inability to withdraw collaterals

## Summary
There is no explicit check for debt remaining on Aave 
## Vulnerability Detail
By intentionally leaving debt on Aave, an attacker can manipulate the value of the collateral assets and potentially cause losses for the SetToken or its users.
## Impact
It result in financial loss for users or the protocol. If the debt is not settled properly, it may accrue additional interest or fees, leading to increased costs for the SetToken or its users. it also lead to an inconsistent state where the debt remains unpaid

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the  checkDebtRemaining function  to explicitly check if there is any debt remaining on Aave before proceeding with the module initialization. Implement the logic within the checkDebtRemaining function to perform the actual debt check. The function should return true if there is no debt remaining and false otherwise.
The checkDebtRemaining function can utilize Aave's contract or external data provider to fetch the debt information associated with the _setToken and determine if there is any remaining debt.
