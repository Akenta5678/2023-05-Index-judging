# Remaining collateral assets get's stuck

## Summary
In AaveV3LeverageModule.sol , while removing the ability of assets to be collateral through `removeCollateralAssets` , it is never checked whether there is a balance of the particular asset in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
While removing borrow assets ,  we could see there is a condition - 
```solidity
 require(underlyingToReserveTokens[borrowAsset].variableDebtToken.balanceOf(address(_setToken)) == 0, "VDR");
```
which ensures that there is no balance of `borrowAsset` remaining in contract, but there is no such condition while removing collateral assets, preventing those assets to be used as collateral again, leading to temporary lockage of those assets . 
## Impact
Temporary lockage of assets.

## Recommendation
Replicate the condition applied in `removeBorrowAssets` for `removeCollateralAssets`.
