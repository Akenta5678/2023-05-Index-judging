# Instant ripcords possible due to no validation check on currentleverageratio being lower than the incentive leverage ratio

## Summary
No valid check on currentleverageratio being lower than the incentive leverage ratio could result in an edge case scenario where an AaveV3 position can be instantly ripcorded 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function engage, the value of current leverage ratio is 10^18 by default shown here:

However, there is no validation to check to make sure that the incentived leverage ratio is more than 10^18

This can result in scenarios where a position is instantly ripcorded. This is because ripcord requires that the Current Leverage Ratio is lower than the incentived leverage ratio

## Impact
A module can be instantly ripcorded

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the constructor, add a check to make sure that the incentive leverage ratio is bigger than 10^18
