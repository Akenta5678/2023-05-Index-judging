# Contract can receive ETH with no way to withdraw

## Summary

The contract ```setToken``` contains a payable ```receive()``` function however contains no functionality to withdraw/retrieve received Ether thus potentially permanently locking all received Ether. 

## Vulnerability Detail

This smart contract represents a vulnerability as it contains a payable receive function that allows it to accept Ether, but it lacks a function to withdraw or transfer this Ether out of the contract. This design flaw essentially creates a black hole for funds: Ether can enter, but it can't leave. Any Ether sent to this contract will be trapped.

## Impact

A permanent loss of Ether received by the contract

```javascript
receive() external payable {}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a withdrawal function, accessible only to a trusted role such as the contract owner, to avoid the permanent loss of funds. Additionally, proper access controls should be enforced to prevent unauthorized withdrawal of funds.
