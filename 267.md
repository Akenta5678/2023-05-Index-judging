# aave borrow and supply caps can lead to functions reverting

## Summary
aave borrow and supply caps can be breached
## Vulnerability Detail
https://docs.aave.com/developers/whats-new/supply-borrow-caps
in the aave protocol, some assets have borrow or supply caps. Borrowing or supplying beyond this cap is not possible.
this is a problem in this protocol. 
```solidity
    function lever(
        ISetToken _setToken,
        IERC20 _borrowAsset,
        IERC20 _collateralAsset,
        uint256 _borrowQuantityUnits,
        uint256 _minReceiveQuantityUnits,
        string memory _tradeAdapterName,
        bytes memory _tradeData
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyManagerAndValidSet(_setToken)
    {
        // For levering up, send quantity is derived from borrow asset and receive quantity is derived from
        // collateral asset
        ActionInfo memory leverInfo = _createAndValidateActionInfo(
            _setToken,
            _borrowAsset,
            _collateralAsset,
            _borrowQuantityUnits,
            _minReceiveQuantityUnits,
            _tradeAdapterName,
            true
        );

        _borrow(leverInfo.setToken, leverInfo.lendingPool, leverInfo.borrowAsset, leverInfo.notionalSendQuantity);

        uint256 postTradeReceiveQuantity = _executeTrade(leverInfo, _borrowAsset, _collateralAsset, _tradeData);

        uint256 protocolFee = _accrueProtocolFee(_setToken, _collateralAsset, postTradeReceiveQuantity);

        uint256 postTradeCollateralQuantity = postTradeReceiveQuantity.sub(protocolFee);

        _deposit(leverInfo.setToken, leverInfo.lendingPool, _collateralAsset, postTradeCollateralQuantity);

        _updateLeverPositions(leverInfo, _borrowAsset);

        emit LeverageIncreased(
            _setToken,
            _borrowAsset,
            _collateralAsset,
            leverInfo.exchangeAdapter,
            leverInfo.notionalSendQuantity,
            postTradeCollateralQuantity,
            protocolFee
        );
    }
```
in the snippet above, the `lever` functions works by first borrowing an asset from aave, this asset is then swapped for the target token and later sent to a pool in this protocol. The problem arises when the AAVE borrow cap has been reached. Because the lever function must first borrow, if the AAVE borrow cap has been, the tx will revert and user will not be able to increase leverage in his position,

inversely this is also present in the `delever` although this deals with supply cap instead of borrow cap.
Let us assume that the supply cap is reached, delever function will not execute and revert because AAVE cannot accept more tokens once the supply cap is reached
## Impact
Because AAVE utilizes supply and borrow caps, when the supply cap is reached this will cause delever to revert. When borrow cap is reached, this will cause lever to revert. A user who wants to delever to avoid a liquidation will not be able to and essentially forced into a liquidation. This is a complete loss of funds for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we recommend logic is added that is not reliant on AAVE borrow and supply caps.
