# AaveLeverageStrategyExtension assumes all USD price feed decimals is 8

## Summary
AaveLeverageStrategyExtension assumes all USD price feed decimals are 8, but this is not always true. AAVE V2 has AMPL is it's [list of deployed assets](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/deployed-contracts/deployed-contracts) and the [price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x492575FDD11a0fCf2C6C719867890a7648d526eB#readContract) is 18 decimals

## Vulnerability Detail
AaveLeverageStrategyExtension will use the wrong decimals and prices for collateral and borrowed assets if it includes AMPL or other assets that are not 18 decimals

## Impact
This would affect leveraging and slippage tolerance and make the contract susceptible to sandwich and bad attacks
