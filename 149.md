# If a sequencer goes down, rebalance, iteraterebalance and _lever may not work

## Summary
Several functions may not work if an L2 sequencer goes down 

## Vulnerability Detail
In Aave, if an L2 sequencer goes down and then goes back up, there is a grace period where borrowing and liquidations are disabled. This is to allow users to pay back bad debt. This can cause functions such as balance, iteraterebalance to revert if the methodology calls for the module to lever up and borrow funds from Aave.

## Impact
The manager may not be able to rebalance the leverage ratio to his target leverage ratio due to an sequencer going down

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the grace period has passed before calling a function that borrows funds from Aave. The following function would be useful here
