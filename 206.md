# Oracle price could be stale

## Summary
priceOracle.latestAnswer() is a deprecated function and it could return stale price. latestRoundData is the recommended function with validation before using the price such as
* timestamp is not too old
* Price > 0
* Round is the latest

## Vulnerability Detail
AaveLeverageStrategyExtension uses chainlink deprecated latestAnswer() which could return stale and incorrect price.

## Impact
Incorrect price could cause a lot of issues such as incorrect leveraging and slippage tolerance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
[Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference) advises against using latestAnswer() and recommends using latestRoundData() instead. It provides data which can be checked to know how recent the price is such as round, and timestamp.
