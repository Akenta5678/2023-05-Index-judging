# Allow a setToken to have too many components and too many external module for every component will cause certain functions not be able to be run

## Summary
Allow a setToken to have too many components and too many external modules for every component will cause certain functions not be able to be run due to EVM gas limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take DebtIssuanceModuleV2#issue as an example,

```solidity
function issue(
        ISetToken _setToken,
        uint256 _quantity,
        address _to
    )
        external
        override
        nonReentrant
        onlyValidAndInitializedSet(_setToken)
    {
        require(_quantity > 0, "Issue quantity must be > 0");

        address hookContract = _callManagerPreIssueHooks(_setToken, _quantity, msg.sender, _to);

        _callModulePreIssueHooks(_setToken, _quantity);

        uint256 initialSetSupply = _setToken.totalSupply();

        (
            uint256 quantityWithFees,
            uint256 managerFee,
            uint256 protocolFee
        ) = calculateTotalFees(_setToken, _quantity, true);

        // Prevent stack too deep
        {
            (
                address[] memory components,
                uint256[] memory equityUnits,
                uint256[] memory debtUnits
            ) = _calculateRequiredComponentIssuanceUnits(_setToken, quantityWithFees, true); // audit => There are 2 loopings of components here. In the first looping, there is a looping of external position

            uint256 finalSetSupply = initialSetSupply.add(quantityWithFees);

            _resolveEquityPositions(_setToken, quantityWithFees, _to, true, components, equityUnits, initialSetSupply, finalSetSupply); // @audit => There is 1 looping of components here. In the looping there is a looping of its external position
            
            _resolveDebtPositions(_setToken, quantityWithFees, true, components, debtUnits, initialSetSupply, finalSetSupply); // @audit => There is 1 looping of components here. In the looping there is a looping of its external position
            _resolveFees(_setToken, managerFee, protocolFee);
        }

        _setToken.mint(_to, _quantity);

        emit SetTokenIssued(
            _setToken,
            msg.sender,
            _to,
            hookContract,
            _quantity,
            managerFee,
            protocolFee
        );
    }
```

1. _calculateRequiredComponentIssuanceUnits

There are 2 loopings of components here. In the first looping, there is a looping of external position

2.  _resolveEquityPositions

There is 1 looping of components here. In the looping there is a looping of its external position

3. _resolveDebtPositions

There is 1 looping of components here. In the looping there is a looping of its external position

## Impact

If too many components and too many external modules is added to the component, it is possible that the function is will always get reverted due to breaching gas limit of a block.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a number as the limit to components and its external module
