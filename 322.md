# DebtIssuanceModule.sol : `removeModule` will not clear the mapping.

## Summary

`issuanceSettings` storage data will not be cleared completely since the structure has the mapping inside.

## Vulnerability Detail

`DebtIssuanceModule.sol` has the `removeModule` which will clear the storage data of `issuanceSettings`

    function removeModule() external override {
        require(issuanceSettings[ISetToken(msg.sender)].moduleIssuanceHooks.length == 0, "Registered modules must be removed.");
        delete issuanceSettings[ISetToken(msg.sender)];
    }

issuanceSettings is map of `mapping(ISetToken => IssuanceSettings) public issuanceSettings;`

when we look at the `IssuanceSettings` structure, it has the following elements.

    struct IssuanceSettings {
        uint256 maxManagerFee;                          // Max issue/redeem fee defined on instantiation
        uint256 managerIssueFee;                        // Current manager issuance fees in precise units (10^16 = 1%)
        uint256 managerRedeemFee;                       // Current manager redeem fees in precise units (10^16 = 1%)
        address feeRecipient;                           // Address that receives all manager issue and redeem fees
        IManagerIssuanceHook managerIssuanceHook;       // Instance of manager defined hook, can hold arbitrary logic
        address[] moduleIssuanceHooks;                  // Array of modules that are registered with this module
        mapping(address => bool) isModuleHook;          // Mapping of modules to if they've registered a hook
    }

As per solidity documentation, delete will not clear the memory of map which is inside the struct.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#delete

so, if struct is deleted, the memory of map will still persist.

`IssuanceSettings`   has the following map - `mapping(address => bool) isModuleHook;`

So, in the issue case, the mapping will not be reset when deleting the struct.

## Impact

Stale data will not be cleared properly. This might a problem when the isModuleHook is removed due to some reason. but still it has the valid state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

After deleting the struct, delete the map separately.
