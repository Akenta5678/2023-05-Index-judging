# BaseManagerV2 lacks interface to interact with module functions

## Summary

Modules have functions that can only be invoked by the manager of the SetToken. However, if the manager is set to be the BaseManagerV2 contract, these functions become inaccessible because BaseManagerV2 does not have a corresponding interface to call them.

## Vulnerability Detail

The AaveV3LeverageModule has functions such as `initialize`, `registerToModule`, `addCollateralAssets`, `removeCollateralAssets`, `addBorrowAssets`, and `removeBorrowAssets` that are restricted to the manager of the SetToken.

However, if the manager is set to be the BaseManagerV2 contract, these functions cannot be invoked. This is because BaseManagerV2 does not have an interface to interact with these functions of the AaveV3LeverageModule.

The functionality of the module will be halted until the manager is changed to another address such as an EOA or a contract with sufficient functions to call those.

## Impact

The lack of interface may affect the functionality and security of the modules such as AaveV3LeverageModule and the SetToken.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement interfaces in BaseManagerV2 or an extension contract that can call these functions of the AaveV3LeverageModule. The same approach is already applied to the `setEModeCategory` function when it is implemented in the AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension extension.
