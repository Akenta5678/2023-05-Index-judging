# Inadequate Protection Against Negative or Zero Price


## Summary

The `_createActionInfo()` function does not handle scenarios where the price data fetched from a Chainlink oracle is negative or zero. This lack of protection can result in improper computations and faulty valuations within the contract, leading to potential economic implications.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink price feeds, used in the contract for real-time price information, return data as `int256`. While the contract accepts these prices as `int256`, it doesn't account for the potential of these prices to be negative or zero. Such values are valid within the scope of `int256` but are not appropriate for price calculations.

Take a look at [AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L884-L907](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L884-L907)

```solidity
    /**
     * Create the action info struct to be used in internal functions
     *
     * return ActionInfo                Struct containing data used by internal lever and delever functions
     */
    function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
        ActionInfo memory rebalanceInfo;

        // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
        // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals.
        // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)
        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
        int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice = rawBorrowPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.borrowDecimalAdjustment);

        rebalanceInfo.collateralBalance = strategy.targetCollateralAToken.balanceOf(address(strategy.setToken));
        rebalanceInfo.borrowBalance = strategy.targetBorrowDebtToken.balanceOf(address(strategy.setToken));
        rebalanceInfo.collateralValue = rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice.preciseMul(rebalanceInfo.collateralBalance);
        rebalanceInfo.borrowValue = rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice.preciseMul(rebalanceInfo.borrowBalance);
        rebalanceInfo.setTotalSupply = strategy.setToken.totalSupply();

        return rebalanceInfo;
    }

```

The issue arises in the following code snippet:

```solidity
int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice = rawBorrowPrice.mul(10 ** strategy.borrowDecimalAdjustment);
```

Here, price data is fetched from Chainlink using the `latestAnswer()` function, and the returned values are used directly without verifying if they are positive. The fetched prices are then multiplied by a power of 10 based on a decimal adjustment associated with the strategy, which leads to the calculation of collateral and borrow values. The contract doesn't guard against scenarios where the Chainlink price might be negative or zero.

## Impact

If the price returned by Chainlink is negative or zero, this will cause incorrect computation of the `collateralPrice` and `borrowPrice`. These inaccuracies will propagate to the valuation of collateral and borrow balances, which may be misrepresented.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

To rectify this vulnerability, it is recommended to incorporate a check that reverts the execution if the Chainlink price is less than or equal to zero. This will ensure that invalid price data does not result in inaccurate token valuations.

It's crucial to consider the edge cases of price data and to include suitable checks to manage these scenarios. This precaution will prevent potential manipulation or unexpected behavior in the contract.
