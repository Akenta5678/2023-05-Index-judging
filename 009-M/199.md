# Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Summary
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.
## Vulnerability Detail
As we know protocol will be deployed on different chains including Arbitrum and Optimism

Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds
If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.
## Impact
Prices may look like they are fresh but in reality they are not. If sequencer go down and stale price is returned `collateralValue` and `borrowValue` may be calculated incorrectly which are used when leveraging and deleveraging.
