## Summary
ripcord caller is incentivized ETH, but this same ETH could also withdrawn by operator instantly without timelock.

## Vulnerability Detail
If operator's withdrawEtherBalance is mined before a user's ripcord is mined, then they won't receive ether reward.

## Impact
User don't get their expected reward.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another check to `withdrawEtherBalance` that's similar to `noRebalanceInProgress` but protects ripcord caller. Or add timelock to ETH withdraws by operator.
