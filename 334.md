# Wrong LTV and threshold LTV when in E-Mode

## Summary

The AaveLeverageStrategyExtension uses`aaveProtocolDataProvider.getReserveConfigurationData` to get the LTV and threshold LTV which are the incorrect numbers when using E Mode. 

This upgrade to the Index-protocol is built to support E mode to unlock higher leverage due to the higher LTV, this is not possible since the incorrect LTV is used. This discrepancy leads to multiple failures of core functionality since parameters will be set by the operator expecting the E-mode parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently the `netBorrowLimit` and `netRepayLimit` are based on the non E-mode LTV and will therefore be smaller than they should be. 

Many functions do not work as they should due to the wrong LVT being used when in E-mode. In the below text, I define `baseLTV` as the LTV when not in E-Mode.

1. If `targetLeverageRate`  > `baseLTV` we will perpetually be attempting to re-balancing without being able to do so because `borrowAmount` will eventually be 0  when we reach `baseLTV`. We never reach the expected leverage and re-balancing to increase LTV will fail. 
2. When in TWAP we can not change methodology settings. If `targetLeverageRate`  > `baseLTV` we will never leave TWAP and will be forced to use `ripcord()` or `disengage`.
4. Delevering is throttled since `netRepayLimit` is wrong due to an incorrect liquidation threshold. Ripcord especially should deleverage as quickly as possible which is not possible puts users at increased risk of liquidation.

## Impact

The core functionality that the protocol was designed for does not work. Many features do not function as expected. `ripcord()` and `disengage()` are throttled since `netRepayLimit` is lower than it should, this increases the risk of liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Get the correct LTV and threshold LTV from `getEModeCategoryData()` in the AAVE3 pool when in E-Mode.
