# XO- Runtime Error in removeStorage Function of StringArrayUtils Library

## Summary
- The` removeStorage` function can cause a `runtime error` if the `index` is equal to the length of the `array`. This can lead to data loss or other problems.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   /**
     * @param A The input array to search
     * @param a The string to remove
     */
    function removeStorage(string[] storage A, string memory a)
        internal
    {
        (uint256 index, bool isIn) = indexOf(A, a);
        if (!isIn) {
            revert("String not in array.");
        } else {
            uint256 lastIndex = A.length - 1; // If the array would be empty, the previous line would throw, so no underflow here
            if (index != lastIndex) { A[index] = A[lastIndex]; }
            A.pop();
        }
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in  the `removeStorage` function in the `StringArrayUtils` library, the problem is this `if (index != lastIndex) { A[index] = A[lastIndex]; }` tries to copy the value of the last element in the array to the element at the index where the string was found, if the index is equal to the length of the array, then the element at the index does not exist. This will cause a runtime error.

## Impact
- If an attacker exploit this vulnerabiity could cause data loss:
    - An attacker sends a malicious transaction to the contract that calls the `removeStorage` function with a string that is not in the array.
    - The `removeStorage` function will check the `indexOf` function to see if the string is in the `array`.
    - The `indexOf` function will return false because the string is not in the` array`.
    - The `removeStorage` function will then try to copy the value of the last element in the `array` to the element at the `index` where the string was found.
    - Since the `index` is equal to the `length` of the `array`, the element at the `index` does not exist.
    -This will cause a `runtime error` and the data in the `array` will be `lost`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  change the `removeStorage` function so that it checks to make sure that the index is less than the length of the array before trying to copy the value of the last element
