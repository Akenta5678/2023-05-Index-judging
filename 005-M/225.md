# Interactions with AMMs typically do not involve the use of `deadline` for operations.

## Summary
When calling the `trade()` function, the `deadline` parameter cannot be set. This limitation could potentially result in users obtaining a suboptimal price and allowing malicious miners to profit from the situation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `trade()` function in the `TradeModule` contract does not include a deadline parameter. Instead, it relies on the `block.timestamp` value, which means the transaction will be considered valid whenever the miner decides to include it in a block, based on the current timestamp.

The absence of a `deadline` can result in transactions being delayed in the mempool and executed at a time later than desired by the user. Consequently, users may end up with a worse price because a validator can intentionally delay the transaction. When the transaction is eventually included in a block, it will be executed based on the current `block.timestamp`, offering no protection to the user.

## Impact
A malicious miner can hold the transaction to deliberately delay its execution without any restrictions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `deadline` parameter to the `trade()` function and ensure it is passed along to AMM calls.
