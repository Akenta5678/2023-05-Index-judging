# No validation check if Slippage Tolerance is set to 0

## Summary

The function _validateNonExchangeSettings has no validation check if slippage tolerance is set to 0. This can results in MEV attacks like sandwich and front running attacks

## Vulnerability Detail

The function _validateNonExchangeSettings has a requirement that slippage tolerance must be lower than 10^18 shown here

However, there is no check if slippage tolerance is set to 0. This would be very dangerous as it would leave the set token contract vulnerable to MEV attacks



## Impact
No validation check means that a set token contract can be vulnerable to slippage, causing a loss of funds
