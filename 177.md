# Unchecked Dependency in the `Position.sol` Contract

## Summary

The `Position.sol` library contract heavily depends on the `ISetToken` contract for several operations, yet it does not verify the legitimacy or the trustworthiness of the `ISetToken` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The library contract `Position.sol` interacts with an instance of `ISetToken` contract in several of its functions. It doesn't validate the contract address, nor does it ensure the correctness of the responses received from the `ISetToken` contract methods. If a malicious `ISetToken` contract is used, it could lead to security issues.

## Impact

Unverified interactions with the `ISetToken` contract can lead to a variety of potential issues. For example, a compromised `ISetToken` contract could return incorrect data or maliciously altered state, causing `Position.sol` to operate under false assumptions. This could potentially lead to loss of funds, incorrect calculations, or other undesired side effects.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function hasDefaultPosition(ISetToken _setToken, address _component) internal view returns(bool) {
    return _setToken.getDefaultPositionRealUnit(_component) > 0;
}

function hasExternalPosition(ISetToken _setToken, address _component) internal view returns(bool) {
    return _setToken.getExternalPositionModules(_component).length > 0;
}

// Other instances follow the same pattern.
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a verification mechanism to ensure the trustworthiness of the `ISetToken` contract. This could be achieved by, for example, checking a registry of trusted contract addresses, or by verifying the contract bytecode. Moreover, consider implementing checks for the correctness of the data returned by `ISetToken` methods.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy the contract `Position.sol` on a test network.
2. Interact with it using a malicious `ISetToken` contract that returns incorrect data.
3. Observe the incorrect operation of `Position.sol` due to the unverified dependency.
