# Attacker can make some functionality of the protocol completely unusable

## Summary
Attacker can make `removeSet()` function unavailable by creating a lot of setTokens

## Vulnerability Detail
In `SetTokenCreator.sol`, we have the `create()` function, which allows anyone to create a setToken. The newly created setToken is then added to the sets array.
```solidity
sets.push(_setToken);
```

To remove a setToken, the owner should call `removeSet()`. Inside this function, the `remove()` function is called, where `indexOf()` loops over the sets array.
```solidity
(uint256 index, bool isIn) = indexOf(A, a);
```
```solidity
function indexOf(address[] memory A, address a) internal pure returns (uint256, bool) {
        uint256 length = A.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (A[i] == a) {
                return (i, true);
            }
        }
        return (uint256(-1), false);
    }
```
If the array is large enough, the loop can revert due to running out of gas. As a result, the `removeSet()` function will revert every time,
rendering this part of the protocol unusable.

A malicious user can easily make this array large enough by creating a lot of setTokens. There are no restrictions on anyone creating any amount of setTokens

## Impact
Malicious user can make removeSet() function unusable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One way to deal with this issue is to set a limit on how many setTokens can be created
