# AaveLeverageStrategyExtension: Risk of Overflow in `_createActionInfo()` due to High underlyingDecimals


## Summary

The AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract has a potential overflow risk due to an assumption that `underlyingDecimals` will not exceed 24. However, if `underlyingDecimals` are above 24, the `_createActionInfo()` function will cause an overflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract makes some hardcoded assumptions about the number of feed decimals (as 8) and also `underlyingDecimals` while performing normalization calculations in the `_createActionInfo()` function.
This assumption should be safe for certain cases, for example WETH is 18 decimals and the ETH/USD chainlink is 8 decimals, but may cause an overflow (and a revert) for the general case when the `underlyingDecimals > 24`, rendering the query from the orracle useless in these cases

Take a look at [createActionInfo()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L884-L907)

```solidity
    /**
     * Create the action info struct to be used in internal functions
     *
     * return ActionInfo                Struct containing data used by internal lever and delever functions
     */
    function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
        ActionInfo memory rebalanceInfo;

// @audit would cause an overflow when underlyingDecimals is above 24
        // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
        // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals.
        // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)
        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
        int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice = rawBorrowPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.borrowDecimalAdjustment);

        rebalanceInfo.collateralBalance = strategy.targetCollateralAToken.balanceOf(address(strategy.setToken));
        rebalanceInfo.borrowBalance = strategy.targetBorrowDebtToken.balanceOf(address(strategy.setToken));
        rebalanceInfo.collateralValue = rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice.preciseMul(rebalanceInfo.collateralBalance);
        rebalanceInfo.borrowValue = rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice.preciseMul(rebalanceInfo.borrowBalance);
        rebalanceInfo.setTotalSupply = strategy.setToken.totalSupply();

        return rebalanceInfo;
    }

```

In this function, an overflow would occur when `underlyingDecimals` is above 24 due to the multiplication by `10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)`. This calculation works on the presumption that `underlyingDecimals` will not be above 24, an assumption that doesn't hold true in all cases.

Proof of Concept

If `underlyingDecimals > 24`, then the expression `36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals` will be negative, and due to Solidity's checked math, it will cause an overflow and a subsequent revert.

## Impact

An overflow could disrupt operations of the functions that rely on the `_createActionInfo()` function.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to include a check for `underlyingDecimals` being above 24 and adjust the calculations accordingly to avoid any potential overflow.
