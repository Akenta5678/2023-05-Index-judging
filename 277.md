# `streamingFeePercentage` value can make `positionMultiplier` increased enormously / hyperinflation

## Summary

`streamingFeePercentage` value can make `positionMultiplier` increased enormously / hyperinflation

## Vulnerability Detail

Some `streamingFeePercentage` values can make `positionMultiplier` increased enormously / hyperinflation when Set Manager input a value which returned a rounded to 0 on `_calculateStreamingFee()` function

At first we might see this seems like a simple user input validation issue, but as mentioned in Sherlock's docs:

> User input validation to prevent user mistakes is not considered a valid issue. However, if a user input could result in a major protocol malfunction or significant loss of funds could be a valid high.

Since there is no minimum fee introduced, also TokenSet / Index Coop provides article about updating fee through Etherscan (which open for an input failure), failed to mitigate will effect to the set, not only to the set manager but will have significant loss of funds of user; which this might categorized as medium issue.

Currently, exist max fee config to prevent Set Manager for such malicious act (for example setting fee 100%), but minimum fee config does not exist.

It can be 0 for sure, so a Set doesn't have any fee, but to be precise the range is not `0 <= x <= maxFee`. It should be `0` or `valid-min <= x <= maxFee`, where `valid-min` should not produce rounding issue in `_calculateStreamingFee` calculation.

```js
File: StreamingFeeModule.sol
203:     function _calculateStreamingFee(ISetToken _setToken) internal view returns(uint256) {
204:         uint256 timeSinceLastFee = block.timestamp.sub(_lastStreamingFeeTimestamp(_setToken));
205:
206:         // Streaming fee is streaming fee times years since last fee
//           example: return (1685330394 - 1685330294) / 31557600;
207:         return timeSinceLastFee.mul(_streamingFeePercentage(_setToken)).div(ONE_YEAR_IN_SECONDS);
208:     }
```

There is an edge case, like:

- `timeSinceLastFee` can be small (because it's a diff between current timestamp with last timestamp).
- `_streamingFeePercentage` can be very small, for example `50` (there is no check anywhere in the code except in `accrueFee` which just check `if (_streamingFeePercentage(_setToken) > 0)`)
- `ONE_YEAR_IN_SECONDS` = 31557600

With this values, `_calculateStreamingFee` will return 0, due to rounding.

Next, the `accrueFee` which is the core function in accruing fees, this previous `0` (inflationFeePercentage) value will be input to `editPositionMultiplier`

```js
File: StreamingFeeModule.sol
086:     function accrueFee(ISetToken _setToken) public nonReentrant onlyValidAndInitializedSet(_setToken) {
087:         uint256 managerFee;
088:         uint256 protocolFee;
089:
090:         if (_streamingFeePercentage(_setToken) > 0) {
091:             uint256 inflationFeePercentage = _calculateStreamingFee(_setToken);
092:
093:             // Calculate incentiveFee inflation
094:             uint256 feeQuantity = _calculateStreamingFeeInflation(_setToken, inflationFeePercentage);
095:
096:             // Mint new Sets to manager and protocol
097:             (
098:                 managerFee,
099:                 protocolFee
100:             ) = _mintManagerAndProtocolFee(_setToken, feeQuantity);
101:
102:             _editPositionMultiplier(_setToken, inflationFeePercentage);
103:         }
104:
105:         feeStates[_setToken].lastStreamingFeeTimestamp = block.timestamp;
106:
107:         emit FeeActualized(address(_setToken), managerFee, protocolFee);
108:     }
```

The issue is on `_editPositionMultiplier`, with `inflationFeePercentage` = 0 will be critical

```js
File: StreamingFeeModule.sol
278:     function _editPositionMultiplier(ISetToken _setToken, uint256 _inflationFee) internal {
279:         int256 currentMultipler = _setToken.positionMultiplier();
280:         int256 newMultiplier = currentMultipler.preciseMul(PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit().sub(_inflationFee).toInt256());
281:
282:         _setToken.editPositionMultiplier(newMultiplier);
283:     }
```

This will update positionMultiplier by multiplying `currentMultipler` with `preciseUnit` (10 \*\* 18) but substracted by `0`, which will be a large number. (Initially `currentMultipler` is 10e18, so multiplying it again with preciseUnit, will be a biger number). The issue will have a lot of derived issue when the `positionMultiplier` is a large number.

Again, even though this seems an input validation issue, but I argue, this is a medium because:

- Set Token previously introduce user (set manager) to familiar with Manual interaction with Etherscan contract interface form input, which open for manual input failure.
- Set Token manager can be anyone (not the dev of Set Token / Index Coop) which might failed to understand the decimal precision etc.
- This issue will affect user holding the SetToken/Index potential for losing asset due to hyper inflation because of big positionMultiplier

## Impact

an excessive growth of the `positionMultiplier` for each streaming fee accrual. This could lead to an unsustainable increase in the value of positions within the protocol, potentially causing instability and devaluing the overall system

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be a valid range `minFee`-`maxFee` setting input for fee, but still accepting the `0` fee
