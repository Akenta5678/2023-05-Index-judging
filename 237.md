# Some iterated arrays are unbounded and could lead to permanent DoS on issue and redeem of set token

## Summary
Some arrays are looped through till the end for some operation. If this array gets too big, operation could require gas that's more than block gas limit and therefore those operations won't be performed. A function that uses these arrays frequently is `issue` and `redeem` in `DebtIssuanceModule`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Unbounded array cases include
* SetToken default and external position during `editPositionMultiplier` or module operations like issue, redeem
* AaveV3LeverageModule's collateralAssets and borrowAssets in `removeModule` and `sync` (which would be called on issue and redeem)
* exchangeNames in AaveLeverageStrategyExtension
* airdrop tokens in AirdropModule can affect operations that rely on `getAirdrops` plus `batchAbsorb` such as [syncing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/hooks/AirdropIssuanceHook.sol#L76-L79)

issue and redeem function in DebtIssuanceModule and DebtIssuanceModuleV2 loop through setToken components 4 times in `_calculateRequiredComponentIssuanceUnits`, `_resolveEquityPositions`, `_resolveDebtPositions`, and `_resolveFees`. But that's after calling `_callManagerPreIssueHooks` and `_callModulePreIssueHooks` which could trigger `AaveV3LeverageModule.sync` and loop through collateralAssets and borrowAssets

## Impact
DoS is possible and it could affect issuance and redemption of setToken. If it affects issuance and redemption, then tokens would be locked. It would be impossible to unlock and regain activity cause they would be needed to remove positions by moving them to 0. The only way to remove position is in [editDefaultPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/lib/Position.sol#L105) and [editExternalPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/lib/Position.sol#L153).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have a limit on number of positions in a setToken.
