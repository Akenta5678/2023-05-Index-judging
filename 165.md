# SetToken name and symbol are not checked for uniqueness - leads to vulnerability for investors.

## Summary
Index Protocol is a market platform where managers will create competitive products using different modules/components and extensions. The individual investors who dont have time and knowledge would be investing in these products in anticipation of good performance.

Most of these Individual investors comes from traditional experience of investing in mutual funds etc as example. They relate to the fund using the name of the fund. In the Web3, the name take a back seat as address of the deployed contracts plays the key role.

As the setToken's name and symbol are not checked for uniqueness across index protocol, it is possible that two different managers with different strategies might have a same name and symbol for settokens. It could also be a strategy of a malicious player to spin an new settoken with same name as a succcessfully operating settoken and entice the user to invest into his malicious product.

Consider name as identifier, many novice investors might fell prey.

Example, if there were 5  google listing on NYSE, it will be hard for investor to identify and invest in the correct listing.

## Vulnerability Detail
SetTokens created in the IndexCoop platform are not checked for uniqueness and could result in misleading the investors to invest in wrong products(instead of intended products).

This opens up vulnerability that misleads the end users.  This is because the name and symbol are not being validated for uniqueness while a new settoken is created.

## Impact
Investors could endup investing in malicious contracts as they failed to uniquely identify the Settoken on the indexcoop.
Keeping the name and symbol unique but not creating Settoken could minimize the issue.

## Code Snippet
SetTokenCreator -> create function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/SetTokenCreator.sol#L66-L110

In the below create function, the logic does not check for name and symbol to be unique and hence resulting in many SetTokens with same name.

```Solidity
 function create(
        address[] memory _components,
        int256[] memory _units,
        address[] memory _modules,
        address _manager,
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        external
        returns (address)
    {
        require(_components.length > 0, "Must have at least 1 component");
        require(_components.length == _units.length, "Component and unit lengths must be the same");
        require(!_components.hasDuplicate(), "Components must not have a duplicate");
        require(_modules.length > 0, "Must have at least 1 module");
        require(_manager != address(0), "Manager must not be empty");
```


Constructor of setToken
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/SetToken.sol#L158-L184

Name and Symbol are not being checked for uniqueness.
```solidity
constructor(
        address[] memory _components,
        int256[] memory _units,
        address[] memory _modules,
        IController _controller,
        address _manager,
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        public
        ERC20(_name, _symbol)
    {
        controller = _controller;
        manager = _manager;
        positionMultiplier = PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnitInt();
        components = _components;

        // Modules are put in PENDING state, as they need to be individually initialized by the Module
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _modules.length; i++) {
            moduleStates[_modules[i]] = ISetToken.ModuleState.PENDING;
        }

        // Positions are put in default state initially
        for (uint256 j = 0; j < _components.length; j++) {
            componentPositions[_components[j]].virtualUnit = _units[j];
        }
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the SetTokenCreator's create function, check for the symbol and name to be unqiue using the hash to ensure each settoken name and symbol are unique on the platform.

this is something similar to having only one listing of Microsoft NYSE. It will be confusing to investors if there were two or more Microsoft listing on NYSE.
