# usage of deprecated `deposit()` function in AAVE v3 integration

## Summary
The `deposit()` function was deprecated in favor of the `supply()` function. A deprecated function should not be used if possible since it's subject to be removed. At that point, the AAVE v3 integration will fail to function since you won't be able to deposit new funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In AAVE v3, `deposit()` was deprecated: https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L720

While the function still exists in the contract it could be removed in the future since AAVE v3 contracts are upgradable.

## Impact
AAVE v3 integration can break because depositing funds won't be possible anymore.

## Recommendation
Use `supply()` instead: https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L145
