# AaveV3 Reward cannot be claimed by SetToken

## Summary

The SetToken may receive reward tokens when interacting with the Aave V3 pool (e.g., depositing). However, the SetToken cannot claim these rewards because the AaveV3 library does not have a function to do so.

## Vulnerability Detail

Aave Protocol V3 offers option to have multiple rewards per token. It is possible for an asset listing to enable additional incentive rewards denominated in their protocol tokens. 
For details please see: https://github.com/aave/docs-v3/blob/main/whats-new/multiple-rewards-and-claim.md

The SetToken contract interacts frequently with the Aave V3 pool (deposit/borrow/repay/withdraw) by using the AaveV3LeverageModuleV3. In case the SetToken receives rewards, it cannot claim them because the AaveV3 library does not have a function to call the `rewardsController.claimRewardsToSelf` function.

## Impact

The rewards are stuck in the rewardsController of Aave V3.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a function in the AaveV3 library that can call the `rewardsController.claimRewardsToSelf` function so that the SetToken can claim the rewards.
