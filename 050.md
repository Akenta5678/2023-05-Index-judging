# Solidity 0.6.10 version is using in `SetTokenCreator.sol` which would result in an out-of-gas error.

## Summary
Solidity 0.6.10 version is using in `SetTokenCreator.sol` which would result in an out-of-gas error.

## Vulnerability Detail
The caller of the `create()` function could potentially pass in a very large array of _components, _units, or _modules, causing the for loop to consume more gas than the block gas limit. The length of these arrays is not limited, and the function does not check the length of these arrays before proceeding. This wouldn't cause an overflow but would result in an out-of-gas error.

## Impact
Lead to wasted resources, as users are paying for gas for transactions that ultimately fail.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract could implement a limit on the length of the arrays that can be passed to the create() function, ensuring that it won't exceed the block gas limit.
