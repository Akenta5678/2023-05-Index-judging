# isValidPool not check totalSupply is zero

## Summary

`isValidPool` not check `totalSupply` is zero. TotalSupply could be 0, which would cause later calculations to fail.  

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    // We expect the totalSupply to be greater than 0 because the isValidPool would
    // have passed by this point, meaning a pool for these tokens exist, which also
    // means there is at least MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY liquidity tokens in the pool
    // https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L121
    // If this is the case, we know the liquidity returned from the pool is equal to the minimum
    // of the given supplied token multiplied by the totalSupply of liquidity tokens divided by
    // the pool reserves of that token.
    // https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L123
    amountAMin = liquidityExpectedFromSuppliedTokens.mul(reserveA).div(totalSupply);
    amountBMin = liquidityExpectedFromSuppliedTokens.mul(reserveB).div(totalSupply);


    function isValidPool(address _pool, address[] memory _components)
        external
        view
        override
        returns (bool) {
        // Attempt to get the factory of the provided pool
        IUniswapV2Factory poolFactory;
        try IUniswapV2Pair(_pool).factory() returns (address _factory) {
            poolFactory = IUniswapV2Factory(_factory);
        } catch {
            return false;
        }

        // Make sure the pool factory is the expected value, that we have the
        // two required components, and that the pair address returned
        // by the factory matches the supplied _pool value
        if(
            factory != poolFactory ||
            _components.length != 2 ||
            factory.getPair(_components[0], _components[1]) != _pool
        ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
```

## Impact

Medium. This does not result in asset loss, but the `isValidPool` function does not behave as expected.    
This error result in unreadable and delays in errors can waste gas.

## Recommendation

Check totalSupply is not zero.
