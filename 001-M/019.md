# USE LATESTROUNDDATA INSTEAD OF LATESTANSWER TO RUN MORE VALIDATIONS

## Summary
The latestAnswer() function is deprecated and does not throw an error if no answer has been reached, instead it returns 0 which can cause an incorrect price

## Vulnerability Detail
`AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol` contract is calling `latestAnswer` to get the asset prices. The latestAnswer is deprecated. Freshness of the returned price should be checked, since it affects an account’s health (and therefore liquidations). Stale prices that do not reflect the current market price anymore could be used, which would influence the liquidation pricing. This method will return the last value, but you won’t be able to check if the data is fresh. On the other hand, calling the method `latestRoundData` allow you to run some extra validations. Stale prices can put funds in a risk. According to Chainlink’s documentation, This function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0, causing an incorrect price
fed to the Price oracle. (https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#solidity). Furthermore, `latestAnswer` is deprecated.

## Impact
According to Chainlink's documentation, the latestAnswer function is deprecated. This function might suddenly stop working if Chainlink stop supporting deprecated APIs. And the old API can return stale data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the latestRoundData function to get the price instead. Add checks on the return data with proper revert messages if the price is stale or the round is uncomplete
