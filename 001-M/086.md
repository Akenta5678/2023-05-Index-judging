# Chainlinkâ€™s latestAnswer() is deprecated

## Summary
The use of chainlink's `latestAnswer()` is deprecated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `latestAnswer()` function returns 0 instead of erroring out if no answers can be reached. This will return the wrong prices for the underlying collateral and borrow tokens.

## Impact
When calling the function `_createActionInfo()`, the collateral and borrow values will have a value of 0 if their price is 0 (if no answers can be reached). This will lead to `_calculateMaxBorrowCollateral()` reverting because of the division by zero error. As such, functions like `disengage()` or `ripcord()` cannot be called.

## Tool used
Manual Review
[comment in the aggregator contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/dev/AggregatorProxy.sol#L33-L43)

## Recommendation
Use `latestRoundData()` as per their [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds#examine-the-sample-contract) and add an additional sanity check to ensure that prices are not stale (old round). For example
```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 price, , uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracle.latestRoundData();
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "...");
require(timeStamp != 0, "...");
```
