# Possible miscalculation of Leverage Ratio because of unchecked Chainlink values

## Summary

The AAVE Leverage Strategy extension uses Chainlink oracles to determine the price of the collateral and the debt to calculate the leverage Ratio. It uses a deprecated way of fetching these prices and is not implementing any further measures to check the validity, which coud result in either 0 or a stale price returned.  

## Vulnerability Detail

In `AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension` chainlinkg Oracles are used to fetch the current price of the collateral and debt Tokens in USD. These prices are later used to calculate the current `leverageRatio`, which in turn is used as a basis for reabalancing or even the call of the `ripcord` function. 

The price is fetched using the [deprecated](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer) `latestAnswer` function from Chainlink. Furthermore, there are no sanity checks done to check if the price is valid or not. 
This can lead to the returned price either be 0 (no data) or stale (if the oracle was paused, or no current data is coming in).

Which in turn results in a wrong calculation of the `leverageRatio` and could result in bad rebalances or even a loss of `ether` because of the `leverageRatio` going wrongly above the `incentivicedRatio` and allows someone to call the ripcord function and get rewards.


## Impact

- wrong prices are used for calculations in rebalancing
- possible loss of ETH because of miscalculated Leverage ratio and misuse of ripcord function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Use `latestRoundData` instead of `latestAnswer` to fetch the price: [see Docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata)
2. Implement additional sanity and staleness checks using the additional returned data from `latestRoundData`
