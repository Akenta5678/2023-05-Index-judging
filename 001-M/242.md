# Use of deprecated Chainlink functions

## Summary

`AaveLeverageStrategyExtension#__createActionInfo` uses a deprecated function to fetch oracle prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer) state that the `latestAnswer` function is deprecated and warns "DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION". It is unwise to continue using deprecated functions because they are outdated and often lack important functionality that can be found in newer alternatives. Also, they can be eventually removed completely, which would be very problematic if the protocol has not prepared for such an event in advance.

## Impact

`latestAnswer` does not throw an error if no answer has been reached, but instead returns 0, possibly causing an incorrect price to be fed to the different price feeds or even a Denial of Service by a division by zero. Moreover, if the returned value is non-zero, there is no way to determine the staleness of the result, meaning outdated prices could be used which could negatively affect users.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
        ActionInfo memory rebalanceInfo;

        // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
        // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals. 
        // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)
        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer(); // @audit latestAnswer is deprecated
        rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
        int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer(); // @audit latestAnswer is deprecated

        // ...
    
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use [`latestRoundData`](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata-1) instead of `latestAnswer`, and make sure to properly validate the returned data.

    function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
