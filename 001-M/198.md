# Use of deprecated chainlink function

## Summary
Chainlink's `latestAnswer` may return incorrect price
## Vulnerability Detail
According to Chainlink’s documentation (API Reference), the `latestAnswer` function is deprecated. This function does not throw an error if no answer has been reached, but instead returns 0, possibly causing an incorrect price to be fed to the different price feeds or even a Denial of Service by a division by zero.

## Impact
This function might suddenly stop working if Chainlink stop supporting deprecated APIs. And the old API can return stale data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to use Chainlink’s latestRoundData() function to get
the price instead. It is also recommended to add checks on the return
data with proper revert messages if the price is stale or the round is
incomplete, for example:
```solidity
1: ( uint80 baseRoundID , int256 answer , , uint256 baseTimestamp , uint80 baseAnsweredInRound ) = assetChainlinkPriceFeed.latestAnswer() ;
2: require( answer > 0, " ChainlinkPriceOracle : answer <= 0");
3: require( baseAnsweredInRound >= baseRoundID , " ChainlinkPriceOracle : Stale price ");
4: require( baseTimestamp > 0, " ChainlinkPriceOracle : Round not complete ");
5: uint256 _price = uint256(answer);
```
