# Lack of access control in `removeModule()`

## Summary
The `removeModule()` in `ClaimModule.sol` marked as external. Everyone could call this function to execute the function and remove modules from the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone could remove modules to cause a major disruption in the protocol's operation.
Let's say Alice is able to call `removeModule()`,  she may able to stop the protocol's services. 

## Impact
User may lose funds.
All claim settings, adapters, and reward pool entries associated with the caller's ISetToken and msg.sender would be deleted. If unauthorized parties invoke this function, legitimate claim settings and reward pool data could be lost, leading to disruptions in the reward distribution or staking mechanisms.
