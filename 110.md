# Wrong calculation in calculateTotalFees

## Summary

The function Redeem allows a user to redeem tokens for the underlying collateral. However, the calculation for the amount of fees  is incorrect due to a misplacement in the  _calculateTotalFees function which is called after settokens are burned. This is inconsistent with the the issue function, where totalFees are calculated before settokens are minted.



## Vulnerability Detail
The function Redeem allows a user to redeem their tokens by burning their set tokens for underlying collateral. In this function, there is the function calculateTotalFees which calculates manager and protocol fees


However, this function is called after set tokens are burned

This is inconsistent with the issue function where calculatetotal fees are called before the settokens are minted 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/DebtIssuanceModuleV2.sol#L94-L115


This can result in possible accounting issues 



## Impact
Manager and the Protocol will receive less fees than expected due to an accounting error 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call _calculateTotalFees before calling burn to make it consistent with the issue function
