# Disengage function does not prevent iterateRebalance from being called

## Summary

The operator can call the `disengage` function in the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension to unwind the leveraged position. However, this function does not clear the `twapLeverageRatio` state variable, which allows the `iterateRebalance` function to be called. If the extension is set up for anyone to call, anyone can call the iterateRebalance function to increase the leverage ratio and prevent the strategy from being shut down by the operator.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `disengage` function in the `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension` allows the operator to unwind the leveraged position by repaying the debt and withdrawing the collateral.

        function disengage(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyOperator {...}

The design is described in the Natspec:
        
        If chunk rebalance size is above max borrow or max trade size, then operator must continue to call this function to complete repayment of loan. The function iterateRebalance will not work.

However, if the strategy is in TWAP, the `disengage` function does not clear the `twapLeverageRatio` state variable. This means that the `iterateRebalance` function can still be called if certain conditions are met.

In the scenario, after calling the `disengage` function, if the current leverage ratio is between 1 and `minLeverageRatio`, the `iterateRebalance` function can be called multiple times to bring the leverage ratio back to `minLeverageRatio`.

        function _validateNormalRebalance(LeverageInfo memory _leverageInfo, uint256 _coolDown, uint256 _lastTradeTimestamp) internal view {
            require(_leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio < incentive.incentivizedLeverageRatio, "Must be below incentivized leverage ratio");
            require(
                block.timestamp.sub(_lastTradeTimestamp) > _coolDown
                || _leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio > methodology.maxLeverageRatio
                || _leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio < methodology.minLeverageRatio, // @audit if current leverage ratio < min leverage ratio, then the iterateRebalance can be call without cooldown.
                "Cooldown not elapsed or not valid leverage ratio"
            );
        }

If the extension is set up for anyone to call (when anyoneCallable = true), anyone can call the `iterateRebalance` function to increase the leverage ratio and stop the strategy from being shut down by the operator.

## Impact

The iterateRebalance function can still be called when disengaging, which violates the design. In case the extension is set up for anyone to call, it may prevent disengaging.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set a state variable `disengaging = true` when operator disengages, and check if `disengaging = true` then do not allow to call `rebalance` or `iterateRebalance`.
