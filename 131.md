# BaseManagerV2 lacks function to remove pending module

## Summary

The SetToken contract has a function called `removePendingModule` that can only be invoked by its manager. However, if the manager is set to be the BaseManagerV2 contract, this function becomes inaccessible because BaseManagerV2 does not have a corresponding function to call it.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `removePendingModule` function in the SetToken contract allows the manager to remove a module that is in the pending state.

        function removePendingModule(address _module) external onlyManager {}

However, if the manager is set to be the `BaseManagerV2` contract, this function cannot be invoked. This is because BaseManagerV2 does not have a function that can interact with the `removePendingModule` function of the SetToken contract.

## Impact

The inability to remove a pending module may affect the functionality and security of the SetToken contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a function in BaseManagerV2 that can call the `removePendingModule` function of the SetToken contract. For example:

```javascript
    function removePendingModule(address _module) external onlyOperator {
        setToken.removePendingModule(_module);
    }
```
