# BaseExtension.sol: `onlyEOA` modifier that ensures call is from EOA might not hold completely true in the future


## Summary

The `BaseExtension` contract implements the `onlyEOA` modifier to ensure that the caller is an externally owned account (EOA) and not a smart contract. However, it is important to note that the introduction of [EIP 3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074) would affect the behavior of this check since it initroduces two new EVM opcodes. While the `onlyEOA` modifier would still hold true for traditional EOAs, users who have signed AUTHCALLs or other EIP 3074 instructions might not be able to execute transactions in the contract since the `require(msg.sender == tx.origin)` condition would prevent them from interacting with the protocol.

NB: The core extension, [AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol) contract heavliy uses the `onlyEOA` modifier which it inherits from [BaseExtension.sol]()

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BaseExtension` contract includes the `onlyEOA` modifier to ensure that the caller is an EOA:

[onlyEOA()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/lib/BaseExtension.sol#L56-L62C1)

```solidity
modifier onlyEOA() {
    require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
    _;
}
```

However, with the introduction of EIP 3074, which allows smart contracts to act on behalf of EOAs using the `AUTH` and `AUTHCALL` instructions, users who have signed such instructions might encounter difficulties executing transactions in the contract. This is because the `require(msg.sender == tx.origin)` condition in the `onlyEOA` modifier would prevent these users from interacting with the protocol.

## Impact

If EIP 3074 is implemented and users have signed AUTHCALLs or other similar instructions, they might not be able to execute transactions in the `BaseExtension` contract and all contracts that inherit from it due to the `onlyEOA` modifier's verification check. This could restrict their access to the protocol's functionalities and potentially result in user experience issues.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the potential impact of EIP 3074 and ensure a more inclusive user experience, it is recommended to reconsider the usage of the `onlyEOA` modifier in the `BaseExtension` contract. Instead of relying solely on the `require(msg.sender == tx.origin)` condition, alternative approaches can be explored.

One option is to update the modifier to allow users who have signed AUTHCALLs or other EIP 3074 instructions to interact with the protocol. This can be achieved by removing the `require(msg.sender == tx.origin)` condition and implementing additional checks to validate the caller's authorization, such as maintaining a whitelist of authorized contracts or implementing a role-based access control mechanism.

Alternatively, if it is desired to strictly restrict interactions to traditional EOAs, the modifier can be kept as is. However, it is important to communicate this limitation to users and provide clear instructions on how to interact with the protocol if they have signed AUTHCALLs or similar instructions.
