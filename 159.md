# AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol: User's Unfair Loss of Ether in `ripcord()`


## Summary

The `ripcord()` function in the contract is designed to be called during periods of high downside volatility and can be invoked by any user. It offers an incentive in the form of Ether rewards for users who trigger the function. However, there is a vulnerability in the implementation that can result in an unfair loss of Ether rewards. If the contract's Ether balance is insufficient to cover the full reward amount, the user's reward is truncated to the available balance, causing the remaining rewards to be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user triggers the `ripcord()` function, the internal function `_transferEtherRewardToCaller` is called to transfer the Ether reward to the caller. However, this function truncates the reward amount to the available Ether balance in the contract. As a result, if a user's rewards at the time of execution exceed the available Ether balance, the excess rewards are lost.

Take a look at the functions below

```solidity
function ripcord(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA {
    // ... code omitted for brevity ...

    uint256 etherTransferred = _transferEtherRewardToCaller(incentive.etherReward);

    // ... code omitted for brevity ...
}
```

[\_transferEtherRewardToCaller()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1212-L1224)

```solidity
function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 etherToTransfer = _etherReward < address(this).balance ? _etherReward : address(this).balance;

    msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer);

    return etherToTransfer;
}
```

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that users who trigger the `ripcord()` function may experience an unfair loss of Ether rewards. If their rewards exceed the available Ether balance in the contract, the excess rewards are effectively forfeited. This can lead to dissatisfaction among users and undermine the intended incentive mechanism.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the risk of users losing their Ether rewards unfairly in the `ripcord()` function, it is recommended to implement a solution that ensures users can receive their rewards in a fair manner while also considering the possibility of the call to `ripcord()` not failing. One possible solution is to implement a mechanism where users can receive their Ether rewards in parts or increments.

By implementing this incremental reward distribution mechanism, users will be able to receive a portion of their rewards even if the contract's Ether balance is insufficient to cover the full reward amount. The remaining balance can be stored in a separate variable or data structure associated with each user, allowing them to claim the outstanding rewards at a later time.

The implementation can involve the following steps:

1. Modify the contract to track the total rewards earned by each user and the rewards already distributed to them.

2. When a user triggers the `ripcord()` function and becomes eligible for rewards, calculate the incremental reward amount they are entitled to based on the available Ether balance in the contract.

3. Transfer the calculated incremental reward amount to the user's account.

4. Update the user's reward balance and the distributed rewards amount.

5. Repeat this process whenever the `ripcord()` function is called, allowing users to accumulate their rewards over multiple invocations until they claim the full amount.

By implementing this incremental reward distribution mechanism, users will no longer experience an unfair loss of Ether rewards. They will have the opportunity to receive their rewards gradually and claim the remaining balance when the contract's Ether balance increases. This approach ensures fairness while maintaining the ability to execute the `ripcord()` function without causing failures due to insufficient Ether balance.

Implementing this mechanism will enhance the user experience and incentivize users to participate in the ripcord functionality, as they can be confident that their rewards will not be unfairly lost.
