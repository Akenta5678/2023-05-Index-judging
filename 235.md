# transfer method is used to send Ether rather than call

## Summary
transfer methods forwards a hardcoded 2300 gas limit and that might not be sufficient for transferring ETH if changes were made to gas requirements.

## Vulnerability Detail
transfer method is used in `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension` to send ETH.

## Impact
The contract might be incompatible on ethereum in the future or other chains.
