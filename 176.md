# Function repay reduces debt for the wrong address.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

To get repay data this function calls getrepaycalldata function which defines Onbehalfof parameter as the Address of the user who will get his debt reduced/removed. Should be the address of the user calling the function if he wants to reduce/remove his own debt, or the address of any other borrower whose debt should be removed. In contrast , the address specified in the function invoke repay is to be always the msg.sender and not (_onbehalfof ) meaning the debt of the address (set token ) will always be reduced even though debt of another address was supposed to be reduced.

 
        ( , , bytes memory repayCalldata) = getRepayCalldata(
            _lendingPool,
            _asset,
            _amountNotional,
            _interestRateMode,
            address(_setToken)
        );
        

## Impact
users can't reduce debt for other borrowers even if they wanted to do so.
