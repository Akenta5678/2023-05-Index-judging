# ETH can be stuck in the SetToken.sol contract as it has the receive() function but doesn't have a method for the withdrawal of the sent ETH

## Summary
contracts with the `receive()` function can receive ETH

## Vulnerability Detail
Now there are many cases of ETH that has been permanently lost on chain because a contract received ETH when it's not supposed to and has no method for the ETH to be withdrawn.

## Impact
The SetToken.sol contract can receive ETH when it's not supposed to and it has no method for the ETH to be withdrawn.
ETH will be permanently locked in the contract.
