# Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Summary
AaveLeverageStrategyExtension doesn't check whether the Arbitrum Sequencer is active when using prices from chainlink oracle.
## Vulnerability Detail
Index protocol is going to launch on arbitrum network.
`AaveLeverageStrategyExtension` is using chainlink oracle in order to get prices. Chainlink recommends to check if arbitrum sequencer [is active](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum) in order to get fresh prices. Otherwise stale prices can be fetched.
## Impact
`AaveLeverageStrategyExtension` can calculate leverage/deleverage amounts incorrectly, because of not fresh prices and as result position can become liquidatable, which will cause loss of fund for SetToken share holders.

## Recommendation
Check that sequencer is not down.
