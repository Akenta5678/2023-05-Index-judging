# onlyEOA modifier that ensures call is from EOA might not hold true in the future

## Summary
The modifier `onlyEOA` is implemented to restrict calls only to Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). However, the implications of EIP 3074 could render this modifier ineffective.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `onlyEOA` modifier uses `tx.origin` to validate that the transaction originates from an EOA and not a smart contract.
```solidity
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
        _;
    }
```

However, [EIP 3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074#abstract) introduces two EVM instructions: `AUTH` and `AUTHCALL`. The former sets a context variable based on an ECDSA signature, and the latter enables a call from the authorized account. This process essentially grants control of the EOA to a smart contract. Therefore, the usage of `tx.origin` to confirm `msg.sender` as an EOA might become unreliable if EIP 3074 is implemented.

## Impact
The reliability of the `onlyEOA` modifier to restrict calls to EOAs might be compromised if EIP 3074 is adopted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's isContract function (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#Address-isContract-address-). However, this approach is not foolproof as it is vulnerable to edge cases such as contracts in the constructor. Therefore, caution should be exercised while using this solution.

```solidity
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        require(!isContract(msg.sender), "Caller must be EOA Address");
        _;
    }
```
