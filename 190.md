# XO- Missing Parameter Passing in SetTokenCreator's create Function

## Summary
- The create function of the `SetTokenCreato`r contract does not pass the `positionState` parameter to the `SetToken` constructor. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as the `SetToken` not performing as expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
      // Creates a new SetToken instance
        SetToken setToken = new SetToken(
            _components,
            _units,
            _modules,
            controller,
            _manager,
            _name,
            _symbol
```
- The  `SetTokenCreator` contract  has vulnerability in the `create` function,  the problem is that the `SetToken` constructor takes an additional parameter, `positionState`, which is the initial state of the position, this parameter is not being passed to the constructor, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
## Impact
- The `SetToken` could be created in an invalid state. This could prevent the `SetToken` from functioning properly.
- The `SetToken` could be created with the wrong initial `positionState`. This could result in the `SetToken` performing differently than expected.
- The `SetToken` could be created with the wrong manager. This could prevent the `SetToken` from being managed properly.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the create function should be updated to pass the positionState parameter to the SetToken constructor.
