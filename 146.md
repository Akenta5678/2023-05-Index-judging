# Cannot rebalance leverage ratio during grace period

## Summary
Rebalancing leverage ratio may not work if an L2 sequencer goes down 

## Vulnerability Detail
In Aave, if an L2 sequencer goes down and then goes back up, there is a grace period where borrowing and liquidations are disabled. This is to allow users to pay back bad debt. This can cause functions such as balance, iteraterebalance to revert if the methodology calls for the module to lever up and borrow funds from Aave.

However, it is important to note that withdraws are not affected by this. This can result in the leverage ratio being off as users will only be be able to redeem settokens.  This can drastically throw off the leverage ratio 


## Impact
The manager may not be able to rebalance the leverage ratio to his target leverage ratio due to an sequencer going down

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the grace period has passed before calling the function engage or disengage from Aave. This will allow the manager to better control the target leverage ratio in the event of a sequencer going down. The following function would be useful here
