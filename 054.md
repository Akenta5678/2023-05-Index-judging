# Unbounded loops in `ClaimModule.sol`

## Summary
Unbounded loops in `ClaimModule.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
The loop in `removeModule()` function - lines https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/ClaimModule.sol#L269-L289, 
each of these loops iterate over an array (setTokenPoolList, adapterList, and rewardPoolList[ISetToken(msg.sender)]). If these arrays are allowed to grow very large, then it's possible for these loops to execute so many times that they consume more gas than the Ethereum network's block gas limit. 

## Impact
This unbounded loop vulnerability because of the loops' runtimes are directly proportional to the sizes of the input arrays. 

If the arrays are allowed to grow without bound, then eventually the loops could take so long to run that they can't be run at all.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe use Mapping Instead of Array
