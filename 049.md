# Lack of access control in `SetTokenCreator.sol` (`create()` function)

## Summary
Allowing anyone to call the SetTokenCreator to create and register new SetTokens that could be an issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the document description of SetTokenCreator and the comment of code, it should be "Factory contract that is enabled by the controller to create and register new SetTokens" (https://docs.indexcoop.com/index-coop-community-handbook/protocols/index-protocol#modules). However, the `create()` function in SetTokenCreator.sol is set to public (everyone could call the function).

```solidity
function create(
        address[] memory _components,
        int256[] memory _units,
        address[] memory _modules,
        address _manager,
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        external ...
```

## Impact
The lack of access control allowed everyone call this function to create and register new `SetToken`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow certain addresses to create SetTokens. These could be admin addresses, or addresses that have been vetted and approved in some way.
