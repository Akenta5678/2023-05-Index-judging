# Tokens sent to `manager` contracts will be lost `forever`.

## Summary
The function `transferTokens` is used to transfer tokens and recover tokens accidentally sent to the manager contracts but the wrong modifier was used in that function preventing it from being called by the `Operator`

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `transferTokens`is guarded by the wrong modifier `onlyExtension` instead of the `onlyOperator` modifier.
Even the comment above the function verifies this fact by stating it.
```solidity
 /**
     * OPERATOR ONLY: Transfers _tokens held by the manager to _destination. Can be used to
     * recover anything sent here accidentally. In BaseManagerV2, extensions should
     * be the only contracts designated as `feeRecipient` in fee modules.
     *
     * @param _token           ERC20 token to send
     * @param _destination     Address receiving the tokens
     * @param _amount          Quantity of tokens to send
     */
    function transferTokens(address _token, address _destination, uint256 _amount) external onlyExtension {
        IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_destination, _amount);
    }

```

## Impact
Unless the extension contracts has a funtion to withdraw this assets it will be trapped forever in the manager contract leading to loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This can be simply corrected by changing the modifier on the function from `onlyExtension` to `onlyOperator`, this ensures that the funtion can be called by Operator.

```solidity
function transferTokens(address _token, address _destination, uint256 _amount) external onlyOperator {
        IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_destination, _amount);
    }
```
