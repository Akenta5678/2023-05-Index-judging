# `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions can be called by anyone

## Summary
`mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions are not protected by any modifiers(access control logic) and thus can be called by anyone. This can influence `totalSupply()` and may even lead to the complete destruction of the project because some functions use `totalSupply()` in  calculations

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` in the `USSD.sol` contract does not have a modifier which protects it from being called by only authorized contracts/people.

## Impact
Minting and burning enormous amount of tokens will be possible. And functions like `collateralFactor()` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` use `totalSupply()` which will eventually result in wrong values being used in the calculation

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow the `USSDRebalancer` contract and maybe the owner to call this function.
