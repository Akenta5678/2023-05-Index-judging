# Use of Deprecated ChainLink function : latestAnswer()

## Summary

According to Chainlinkâ€™s documentation (API Reference), the latestAnswer function is deprecated. This function does not throw an error if no answer has been reached, but instead returns 0, possibly causing an incorrect price to be fed to the different price feeds or even a Denial of Service by a division by zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

Deprecated latestAnswer() function usage when gathering price for rawCollateralPrice and rawBorrowPrice

## Impact

rawCollateralPrice and rawBorrowPrice could be set to 0 if an answer if not reach, moreover the fact that no check is made regarding the strict positive value of `strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer()` call

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L895-L897
```solidity
        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer(); 
        int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer(); 
```
It is also present in these out of scope contracts : 

- ./index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/FlexibleLeverageStrategyExtension.sol:        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
- ./index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/FlexibleLeverageStrategyExtension.sol:        int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Based on https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data, the followings can be done to avoid using a stale price returned by the Chainlink price feed.

- The latestRoundData function can be used instead of the deprecated latestAnswer function.
- roundId and answeredInRound are also returned. "You can check answeredInRound against the current roundId. If answeredInRound is less than roundId, the answer is being carried over. If answeredInRound is equal to roundId, then the answer is fresh."
- "A read can revert if the caller is requesting the details of a round that was invalid or has not yet been answered. If you are deriving a round ID without having observed it before, the round might not be complete. To check the round, validate that the timestamp on that round is not 0."
