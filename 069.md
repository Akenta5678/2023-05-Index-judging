# using `transfer()` for send eth could cause issue

## Summary

`AaveLeverageStrategyExtension` contract use `transfer()` for send eth for sending reward. This could cause `ripcord()` call unexpectedly revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

Any smart contract that uses `transfer()`  is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: 2300.  Each opcode supported by the EVM has an associated gas cost, If gas costs are subject to change, then smart contracts canâ€™t depend on any particular gas costs (like fixed amount 2300).

## Impact

This can cause function that depend on this call, could revert

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

switch to using call() instead : 

```solidity
    function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) internal returns(uint256) {
        uint256 etherToTransfer = _etherReward < address(this).balance ? _etherReward : address(this).balance;
 
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(etherToTransfer)("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed.");

        return etherToTransfer;
    }
```

```solidity
    function withdrawEtherBalance() external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed.");
    }
```
