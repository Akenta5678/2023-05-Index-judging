# Not using eMode's risk parameters configurations to calculate the maxBorrow/repayAmount when eMode is activated

## Summary
The protocol has extended the [AaveLeverageStrategyExtension](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol) contract to be compatible with Aave V3, as part of this upgrade, the protocol has created a [new adapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension.sol) to enable the new eMode feature offered by Aave V3 to enhance capital efficiency.
The problem is that **when an eMode category is set for a setToken, the protocols actually don't use the enhanced risk parameters for the eMode category**, instead, all the computation still uses the [**individual collateral's risk parameters**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1098)


## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol [allows setting an eMode category on setTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L55-L68), but it doesn't pull the risk parameters of the eMode category when [computing the max borrow/repay amount allowed in base units for lever / delever](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1095-L1119), instead, it [still continues to pull the risk parameters of the individual collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1097-L1098)

- Not using the eMode configurations for a reserve that has been configured to use one of the EMode categories will make that all the users can't take advantage to extract the highest borrowing power out of their collateral.
- Not using the EMode configurations will limit the borrowing power of the users which that can be translated as limiting how much value users can get out of locking their collaterals.
  - [eMode configurations store crucial data](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/protocol/libraries/types/DataTypes.sol#L71-L79), such as, `ltv`, `liquidationThreshold`, `liquidationBonus`, `priceSource` (A custom oracle to compute the price for all the assets of the eMode category)

- The fact that a reserve is configured in Aave to use an EMode, but the Index protocol doesn't take it into account and makes all the computations using the normal risk parameters, apart from limiting the user's borrowing power, the Index Protocol will be out of sync compared to Aave, which could lead to breaking the internal mechanisms because the mismatch in the computed values between the Index Protocol and Aave.

- For example, **EMode for stablecoins has a 98% liquidation threshold, compared to an 80% for DAI when EMode is not enabled.**
- As per the Technical Paper, **If EMode is enabled, Aave overrides the LTV & Liquidation Threshold of the individual collateral and instead uses the risk parameters of the EMode category, which allows higher capital efficiency.**

## Impact
- Limiting the borrowing power that positions could get out of their collateral because the computation uses the `ltv` value of the individual collateral, positions borrowing less than what they could really borrow for the exact same amount of collateral.

- Not taking advantage of the enhanced `liquidationThreshold` of the eMode category to compute the needed repayment amount, which could be translated as because of not using the `liquidationThreshold` of the eMode category, positions will need to delever and sell a portion of their debt to lower the `liquidationThreshold` below the `liquidationThreshold` of the individual collateral.

- Index Protocol will be out of sync compared to the real values that Aave is operating with.
  - This could lead to incorrect computations that in the best scenario, it will cause the position to not gain the benefits of the capital efficiency and at worst it could end up breaking the internal accounting, breaking system invariants

## Tool used
Manual Review & [Aave V3 Techincal Paper](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/techpaper/Aave_V3_Technical_Paper.pdf) & [Official Aave v3 Documentation about Risk Parameters](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters)

## Recommendation
- **When the setToken is indeed using an EMode**, ***pull the eMode configuration's data instead of pulling the normal reserve configuration's data.***
- Make sure to check the Aave documentation for further guidance on how to integrate the pulling of the eMode configuration's data. Hint, eMode configuration's data is accessible only through the IPool interface
https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool#getemodecategorydata
- A quick example of how this could possible be done:
```solidity
function _calculateMaxBorrowCollateral(ActionInfo memory _actionInfo, bool _isLever) internal view returns(uint256) {
    ...
    ...
    uint256 maxLtvRaw
    uint256 liquidationThresholdRaw

    // Pull the eMode category set for the setToken
    uint _eModeCategoryId = _pool.getUserEMode(setTokenAddress);

    // if eMode is activated
    if (_eModeCategoryId != 0) {
        DataTypes.EModeCategory memory eModeData;
        eModeData = _pool.getEModeCategoryData(_eModeCategoryId);
        maxLtvRaw = eModeData.ltv;
        liquidationThresholdRaw = eModeData.liquidationThreshold;
    } else {
        ( , maxLtvRaw, liquidationThresholdRaw, , , , , , ,) = strategy.aaveProtocolDataProvider.getReserveConfigurationData(address(strategy.collateralAsset));
    }
    ...
    ...
}
```
