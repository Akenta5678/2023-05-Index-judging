# The calculation of the price of DAI is wrong in `getPriceUSD()`

## Summary
The calculation of the price of DAI in StableOracleDAI.sol contract is wrong

## Vulnerability Detail
The final price of DAI in USD is calculated with the formula -
```solidity
return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
    
```
However, this is wrong as `(DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2` would give the price of WETH in DAI / 2 (ie, if WETH price in DAI is 1800 then it would be 900)
And when it is divided as a whole, the entire value will not be the desired value of DAI.

## Impact
Incorrect calculation leading to wrong computing of `mintForToken()` and  `collateralFactor()` functions

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommended option is to just use Chainlink feed for DAI which gives the correct price of DAI.
