# Fee Assignment Vulnerabilities in Controller Contract

## Summary

The Controller contract manages a number of resources including modules and factories, and it also manages fees assigned to these modules. However, the contract allows for fees to be assigned and edited without proper checks. This can potentially allow a malicious owner to assign unexpected or excessive fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `addFee` and `editFee` functions, the Controller contract doesn't have a maximum limit on the fee percentage that can be set. There's also no check to see if the new fee percentage is less than or equal to 100%. This could lead to a situation where fees are unexpectedly high, causing issues in other parts of the system that interact with these fees.

In addition, the `editFee` function allows an existing fee to be modified, which could be used to unexpectedly increase fees. While this action can only be done by the contract owner, it's generally a good practice to enforce restrictions or checks on such actions to ensure the stability of the system.

## Impact

If exploited, this could lead to the assignment of excessive fees that could lead to a drain of funds in the system, affecting users who interact with these modules. It could also lead to potential issues in other parts of the system that expect reasonable fee percentages.

## Code Snippet

The relevant functions in the Controller contract are:

```solidity
function addFee(address _module, uint256 _feeType, uint256 _newFeePercentage) external onlyInitialized onlyOwner {
    require(isModule[_module], "Module does not exist");
    require(fees[_module][_feeType] == 0, "Fee type already exists on module");
    fees[_module][_feeType] = _newFeePercentage;
    emit FeeEdited(_module, _feeType, _newFeePercentage);
}

function editFee(address _module, uint256 _feeType, uint256 _newFeePercentage) external onlyInitialized onlyOwner {
    require(isModule[_module], "Module does not exist");
    require(fees[_module][_feeType] != 0, "Fee type does not exist on module");
    fees[_module][_feeType] = _newFeePercentage;
    emit FeeEdited(_module, _feeType, _newFeePercentage);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended to add an upper bound check on the `_newFeePercentage` in the `addFee` and `editFee` functions to ensure that the fee percentage can't exceed 100%. This can be done by adding a `require` statement that checks this condition, like so:

```solidity
require(_newFeePercentage <= 100, "Fee percentage cannot exceed 100%");
```

Furthermore, consider adding a restriction or a workflow for editing fees to ensure stability in the system. This could be in the form of a time lock, or a requirement for multiple signatures.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy the Controller contract with a valid `_feeRecipient` address.
2. Call the `addFee` function with a `_newFeePercentage` greater than 100%. The function will successfully execute.
3. Similarly, if you call the `editFee` function with a `_newFeePercentage` greater than 100% on a fee that already exists, the function will also successfully execute.
