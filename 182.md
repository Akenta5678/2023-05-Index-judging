# Inadequate Access Control in addComponent Function

## Summary:
The `addComponent` function in `SetToken.sol` is subject to inadequate access control vulnerability. This function can add a new component to the `components` array but there is a lack of authorization check allowing only authorized addresses to add new components. This could allow any address to modify the state of the contract by adding new components to the `components` array.

## Vulnerability Detail:

In the contract `SetToken`, the function `addComponent` is marked with two modifiers `onlyModule` and `whenLockedOnlyLocker`. The `onlyModule` modifier checks if the caller is an initialized module but does not prevent other addresses from calling the function. The `whenLockedOnlyLocker` modifier restricts access when the contract is locked but allows all addresses to call the function when it's not locked.

## Impact:

An attacker could add malicious components to the `components` array and potentially disrupt the intended functionality of the contract. This could lead to unexpected behaviors and even loss of funds if the added component is malicious and has a functionality that compromises the safety of the contract.

## Code Snippet:

```solidity
function addComponent(address _component) external onlyModule whenLockedOnlyLocker {
    require(!isComponent(_component), "Must not be component");
    
    components.push(_component);

    emit ComponentAdded(_component);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation:

Consider implementing additional access controls to ensure only authorized addresses can call the `addComponent` function. This could be achieved by maintaining a list of approved addresses or by introducing roles with the OpenZeppelin Access Control library.

## Proof Of Concept:

Here are the steps to reproduce the vulnerability:

1. Deploy the contract `SetToken.sol` with the constructor parameters filled with the proper addresses and values.
2. Call the function `addComponent` with any address. This will add the address to the `components` array.
3. Call the `getComponents` function to verify that the address has been added to the `components` array. This shows that any address can call the `addComponent` function and add new components.
