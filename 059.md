# AAVEv3 deposits will stop working at some point because deprecated function is used.

## Summary

In the `AAVEv3` library there is a function `getDepositCalldata` to get the calldata for a deposit call. However, there is the  signature of the `deposit` function used, which was deprecated and might be removed by the Aaave team.

## Vulnerability Detail

To deposit/supply assets to AAVeV2 there was a `deposit` function on the main Pool contract. But with AAVEv3 they changed the interface and the function to be used is now called `supply`. 
However, the developers seem to have missed this while updating their library for the use with AAVEv3, as the `getDepositCalldata` still encodes a Signature of `deposit`.
For now this will still work, as there is a `deposit` function on AAVeV3 pool for backwards compatability. 
But this function is deprecated and might be removed in the future by the AAVE protocol. 

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IPool
/// @dev Deprecated: maintained for compatibility purposes
  function deposit(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint16 referralCode
  ) external virtual override
```

In the [AAVE docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool) there is not even a mention of the `deposit` function anymore.

If they remove the function  it will result in a revert, when this calldata is actually used in the `SetToken` contract using the `invokeDeposit` function. 

## Impact

SetTokenÂ´s cannot deposit to AAVE in future as the transaction will always revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use correct Signature for new `supply` function.

```solidity
 bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSignature(
            "supply(address,uint256,address,uint16)"
            _asset, 
            _amountNotional, 
            _onBehalfOf,
            _referralCode
        );
```
