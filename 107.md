# EOA can lose part of reward after make call to the ripcord function

## Summary
The caller of the [ripcord() function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1218) can lose part of the reward in Ether.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) internal returns(uint256) {
        uint256 etherToTransfer = _etherReward < address(this).balance ? _etherReward : address(this).balance;

        msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer);

        return etherToTransfer;
    }
```

After EOA makes the call to the ripcord function, in return for a reward, [the contract will send ETH to the EOA](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1218). but the user will get all rewards only if the user's reward is less than the contract balance. so if the user reward is 0.3 ETH and the contract balance is 0.2 ETH, the user will get only 0.2 ETH and 0.1 ETH get lose because there is not any code to track the user's pending reward.

## Impact
The caller of the ripcord function can lose part of the reward in Ether.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
store the unpaid part of the user's reward so the user can claim it in the future.
