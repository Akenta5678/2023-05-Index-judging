# XDZIBEC- Integer Division Truncation Vulnerability in "Vesting" Contract

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in the `claim()` function that can be called by anyone, not just the `recipient`, `allowing unauthorized access to the funds`. 
This security issue it can lead to loss of funds. 
To fix this vulnerability,the `claim()` function should only be `callable` by the `recipient`. 
This can be done by adding a modifier to the function that checks if the `caller` is the `recipient`. 
For example, modifier `onlyRecipient(){ require(msg.sender == recipient, "TreasuryVester.claim: unauthorized"); _; }` can be added to the contract, and then the `claim() `function can be modified to include this modifier: function `claim() public onlyRecipient`.


## Vulnerability Detail

 ```SOLIDITY
 function claim() public {
        require(block.timestamp >= vestingCliff, "TreasuryVester.claim: not time yet");
        uint256 amount;
        if (block.timestamp >= vestingEnd) {
            amount = IERC20(index).balanceOf(address(this));
        } else {
            amount = vestingAmount.mul(block.timestamp.sub(lastUpdate)).div(vestingEnd.sub(vestingBegin));
            lastUpdate = block.timestamp;
        }
        IERC20(index).transfer(recipient, amount);
    }
}
```
The vulnerability in the `claim` function arises from the use of integer division without considering the possibility of truncation. In Solidity, when dividing two integers, the result is always truncated towards zero.
This means that the fractional part of the division is discarded, leading to potential inaccuracies.
The `amount` variable is calculated using integer division with the `div` function. Here's a breakdown of the calculation:
-` block.timestamp.sub(lastUpdate)` This calculates the time difference between the current timestamp (block.timestamp) and the lastUpdate variable.
- `vestingEnd.sub(vestingBegin)` This calculates the total time duration between the vesting end and vesting begin timestamps.
- `vestingAmount.mul(block.timestamp.sub(lastUpdate))` This multiplies the vesting amount by the time difference calculated in step 1.
- `vestingAmount.mul(block.timestamp.sub(lastUpdate)).div(vestingEnd.sub(vestingBegin))` This performs integer division between the   
   result of step 3 and the time duration calculated in step 2, assigning the result to the amount variable.
The vulnerability lies in the truncation that occurs during the division in step 4. If the division does not yield an exact integer value, the fractional part will be discarded, leading to potential inaccuracies in the transferred amount.


## Impact

-If the division truncation occurs, the `amount` variable will hold an incorrect value. 
Consequently, the incorrect `amount` will be transferred to the recipient, potentially resulting in loss or undesired behavior.

- To exploit the vulnerability  An attacker would need to provide input that triggers the claim function. By manipulating the values of `vestingBegin`, `vestingEnd`, `vestingAmount,` and `block.timestamp`, an attacker could cause the division truncation to occur, resulting in an incorrect amount being transferred

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- It is recommended to use a division method that handles fractional values correctly. One possible approach is to use fixed-point arithmetic, which involves representing fractional numbers as scaled integers. Another option is to use a library or implementation that supports arbitrary precision arithmetic, ensuring accurate calculations with fractional values
