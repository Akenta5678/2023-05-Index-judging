# Dos attack to engage()

## Summary
By monitoring the transaction pool and transferring a negligible amount (1 wei) of the borrow asset into the contract beforehand, the malicious actor can cause the engage() function to fail at the require statement that checks for a zero borrow balance. Consequently, this disruption prevents the intended transaction from taking place, undermining the normal operation of the contract and potentially exposing it to exploitation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `engage()` function performs several validations, calculates rebalance notional amounts, executes leverage trading, and updates the rebalance state.The borrow balance represent the amounts of borrow asset held by the "setToken" contract. As the code below,it requires that the borrow balance is zero.   Here is the problem,a bad actor can monitor the transactions in the pool and preemptively transfer a minimal amount (1 wei) of the borrow asset into the contract. When the engage() function is executed, the require statement require(engageInfo.borrowBalance == 0, "Debt must be 0"); will fail because the borrow balance is not zero, even though the actor's transfer is negligible.
```solidity
    function engage(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyOperator {
        ActionInfo memory engageInfo = _createActionInfo();

        require(engageInfo.setTotalSupply > 0, "SetToken must have > 0 supply");
        require(engageInfo.collateralBalance > 0, "Collateral balance must be > 0");
        require(engageInfo.borrowBalance == 0, "Debt must be 0");
```

## Impact
As a result, this failure in the require statement prevents the transaction from proceeding, effectively blocking the engage() function from executing and disrupting the intended behavior of the contract.
