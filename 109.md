# In AaveV3leverageModule.sol's delever() function there's no check to ensure that `_minRepayQuantityUnits` is directly proportional to `_redeemQuantityUnits`

## Summary
There should be slippage protection in the delever() function

## Vulnerability Detail
The delever() function in AaveV3LeverageModule.sol Performs a DEX trade, exchanging the _collateralAsset for _repayAsset. It also decrease leverage for a given collateral position.

Now the delever() function doesn't have slippage protection which means that the trade can potentially be executed without considering the acceptable deviation in the trade price. As a result, the actual trade execution might deviate significantly from the expected trade price, which could have adverse effects on the outcome of the deleverage operation.

Without slippage protection, the trade could experience high price slippage. **This could result in receiving a smaller amount of the repay asset in return for the collateral asset.**

there should be a check to ensure that only a certain percentage in price slippage is allowed during the deleverage operation.

in a situation like Network Congestion which happens regularly in Mainnet this can happen as the transaction will be delayed for a period of time.

## Impact
the minimum amount of repayAsset that we receive in exchange for the collateralAssets can be much smaller compared to the amount of collateralAsset we withdrew from Aave due to price slippage.
