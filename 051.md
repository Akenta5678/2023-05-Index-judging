# Protocol will not work with fee on transfer tokens

## Summary
Protocol will not work with fee on transfer tokens, as `ExplicitERC20.transferFrom` checks that exactly same balance was received.
## Vulnerability Detail
`ExplicitERC20.transferFrom` function is used through the whole protocol in order to make transfers.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/lib/ExplicitERC20.sol#L43-L70
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        IERC20 _token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _quantity
    )
        internal
    {
        // Call specified ERC20 contract to transfer tokens (via proxy).
        if (_quantity > 0) {
            uint256 existingBalance = _token.balanceOf(_to);

            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                _token,
                _from,
                _to,
                _quantity
            );

            uint256 newBalance = _token.balanceOf(_to);

            // Verify transfer quantity is reflected in balance
            require(
                newBalance == existingBalance.add(_quantity),
                "Invalid post transfer balance"
            );
        }
    }
```
As you can see, this function checks in the end that exactly `_quantity` was received after the transfer.
Because of that protocol will not be working with fee on transfer tokens as SetToken components. [Issuing of SetToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/BasicIssuanceModule.sol#L107-L112
) will not be possible as `ModuleBase.transferFrom` function uses `ExplicitERC20.transferFrom` function.
## Impact
Protocol is not compatible with fee on transfer tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to make `ExplicitERC20.transferFrom` function work with fee on transfer tokens, you don't need to check exact amount to be received. But, as this function is used across whole protocol, it can not just simple and changing can create another problems.
