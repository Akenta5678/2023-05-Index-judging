# HardCoded Chainlink Feed Decimals Risk in AaveLeverageStrategyExtension Contract

## Summary

The AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract is found to be hardcoded with the assumption that Chainlink oracles return feed decimals as 8. This is risky as Chainlink feed decimals vary and can be as high as 18.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_createActionInfo()` function, prices are normalized to account for potential discrepancies between feed and token decimals and the expected return value. However, the assumption made here that Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places is not universally accurate. This hardcoded assumption could potentially lead to inaccurate price valuation.

Take a look at [createActionInfo()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L884-L907)

```solidity
    /**
     * Create the action info struct to be used in internal functions
     *
     * return ActionInfo                Struct containing data used by internal lever and delever functions
     */
    function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
        ActionInfo memory rebalanceInfo;

// @audit not all feed decimals are 8
        // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
        // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals.
        // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)
        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
        int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice = rawBorrowPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.borrowDecimalAdjustment);

        rebalanceInfo.collateralBalance = strategy.targetCollateralAToken.balanceOf(address(strategy.setToken));
        rebalanceInfo.borrowBalance = strategy.targetBorrowDebtToken.balanceOf(address(strategy.setToken));
        rebalanceInfo.collateralValue = rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice.preciseMul(rebalanceInfo.collateralBalance);
        rebalanceInfo.borrowValue = rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice.preciseMul(rebalanceInfo.borrowBalance);
        rebalanceInfo.setTotalSupply = strategy.setToken.totalSupply();

        return rebalanceInfo;
    }

```

The code snippet above demonstrates the problematic assumption, as the comment suggest the feed decimals are assumed to be 8, This assumption should be safe for certain cases, for example WETH is 18 decimals and the ETH/USD chainlink is 8 decimals, but say the feed decimals are actually 18, the calculation of `(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)` would be off by 10, which would result in significantly inaccurate price valuations.

## Impact

The hardcoded assumption of 8 feed decimals can result in significant miscalculations within the `_createActionInfo()` function, leading to potential under or over-valuation of collateral and borrow prices. As this function is instrumental in many critical contract operations, such as leverage and deleverage functions, this risk could have serious implications on the overall functioning and accuracy of the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of hardcoding the feed decimals to 8, it is recommended to dynamically fetch the actual decimals from the Chainlink feed. The multiplication operation should then use `10^(36 - feedDecimals - underlyingDecimals)` to ensure accurate calculations.
