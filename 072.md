# Incorrect Calculation in rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice can break the protocol

## Summary
The function _createActionInfo calculates the collateral price by multiplying the price returned by the oracle by the collateralDecimalAdjustment set by the manager. This is done under the assumption that Chainlink prices are returned in 8 decimals shown here. However, this is only true for fiat pairs. For ETH pairs the price is returned in 18 decimals. This can result in an incorrect calculations of the borrow and collateral price in the function _createActionInfo which is used in many internal functions.
