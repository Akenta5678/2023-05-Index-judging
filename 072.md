# call() should be used instead of transfer() on an address payable

## Summary
call() should be used instead of transfer() on an address payable

## Vulnerability Detail
The transfer() and send() functions forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs. For example. EIP 1884 broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.

## Impact
The use of the deprecated transfer() function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:
• The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
• The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
• The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, 
   raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
• Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

## Code Snippet
In AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol, withdrawEtherBalance() function is given as below,

```solidity
File: contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol

583    function withdrawEtherBalance() external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
584        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
585    }
```

In AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol, _transferEtherRewardToCaller() function is given as below,

```solidity
File: contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol

    function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) internal returns(uint256) {
        uint256 etherToTransfer = _etherReward < address(this).balance ? _etherReward : address(this).balance;

        msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer);

        return etherToTransfer;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use call() instead of transfer(), but be sure to respect the Check Effect Interaction(CEI) pattern.

For example:

```solidity

    function withdrawEtherBalance() external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
-        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
+       uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
+       (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value:amount}("");
+        require(success, "transfer failed");
    }
```
