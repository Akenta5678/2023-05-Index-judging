# AaveV3LeverageModule borrows from AaveV3 without checking if the asset is siloed

## Summary

AaveV3 assets can be siloed. Borrowing siloed assets has limitations. AaveV3LeverageModule should add to its validations if the AaveV3 asset is siloed before borrowing.

## Vulnerability Detail

Aave v3 has a new feature of siloed assets. As per Aave docs "This feature allow assets with potentially manipulatable oracles (for example illiquid Uni V3 pairs) to be listed on Aave as single borrow asset. This means that if an asset is configured as siloed, it can't be borrowed in a position at the same time as with other assets." 

When `AaveV3LeverageModule` adds new borrow assets to its list it does not validate if the asset is siloed.

## Impact

Currently there is no asset marked siloed in any of the V3 markets. However, Aave Risk or Pool admins have the ability to set assets as siloed. 

Index protocol AaveV3LeverageModule can have a borrow positions on multiple assets. Because on adding borrow assets, siloed verifications are not made, if attempts are made to borrow a siloed asset, the process will fail unexpectedly. Two situations can occur if the borrowing of siloed assets is tried:

1. If the asset is siloed and it is the first position to be borrowed, the borrow will be successful. If other borrows are tried they will fail.
2. If there are borrowed positions of assets and the borrow of a siloed asset is tried it will fail. 

## Code Snippet

On AaveV3LeverageModule.sol borrow assets can be added on module `initialize`, or after by calling `addBorrowAssets`. 

Function used for new borrow asset validation `_validateNewBorrowAsset`.

AaveV3 `validateBorrow` where the siloed check is made.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

On `_validateNewBorrowAsset()` there should be an additional check if the borrow asset is siloed. In case of error, it should revert with the proper error message.
