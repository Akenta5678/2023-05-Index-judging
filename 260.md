# locker get initialized instead of checking

## Summay
 SetToken.lock function is only called when  modulestate for msg.sender is set to INITIALIZED and when it is locked i.e; only the locker (a module) can call, now in the very next line L345 it is initializing the msg.sender to locker variable, which is not suppose to be the case in this since from the comment it says ```only the locker can call privileged functions``` i.e, it is checking that if msg.sender is locker or not, than it marked isLocked = true , As we can see similar check under unlock function, which is checking if locker is msg.sender or not than it proceeds to the following operations:
```solidity
function unlock() external onlyModule {
        require(isLocked, "Must be locked");
        require(locker == msg.sender, "Must be locker");
        delete locker;
        isLocked = false;
    }
```
and under lock function it is doing like: 
``` solidity
require(!isLocked, "Must not be locked");
        locker = msg.sender
```

## Impact
whenever a user with INITIALIZED module called this function it sets locker to msg.sender instead of checking if msg.sender is locker or not! which can break the functionality of lock function the intended cause for which it was designed!!

## Recommendation
Use  
```solidity 
require(locker == msg.sender, "Must be locker");
``` 
instead of directly initializing it!
