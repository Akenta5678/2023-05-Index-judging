# Deadline is hardcode to block.timestamp in DexAdapter can cause problem like sandwich attack in aave extensions.

## Summary
Deadline in DexAdapter.sol is hardcoded to block.timestamp, that can cause the immediate revert is current time stamp passes and also expose the protocol to sanwich attacks
## Vulnerability Detail
Following are the functions in the dexAdapter that are used for swapping after performing the trade on aave to create the leverage:
```solidity
 function _swapTokensForExactTokensUniV3( 
        address[] memory _path,
        uint24[] memory _fees,
        uint256 _amountOut,
        uint256 _maxAmountIn,
        ISwapRouter _uniV3Router
    )
        private
        returns(uint256)
    {

        require(_path.length == _fees.length + 1, "ExchangeIssuance: PATHS_FEES_MISMATCH");
        _safeApprove(IERC20(_path[0]), address(_uniV3Router), _maxAmountIn);
        if(_path.length == 2){
            ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams memory params =
                ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams({
                    tokenIn: _path[0],
                    tokenOut: _path[1],
                    fee: _fees[0],
                    recipient: address(this),
                    deadline: block.timestamp,
                    amountOut: _amountOut,
                    amountInMaximum: _maxAmountIn,
                    sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
                });
            return _uniV3Router.exactOutputSingle(params);
        } else {
            bytes memory pathV3 = _encodePathV3(_path, _fees, true);
            ISwapRouter.ExactOutputParams memory params =
                ISwapRouter.ExactOutputParams({
                    path: pathV3,
                    recipient: address(this),
                    deadline: block.timestamp,
                    amountOut: _amountOut,
                    amountInMaximum: _maxAmountIn
                });
            return _uniV3Router.exactOutput(params);
        }
    }
```
also in

```solidity
    function _swapExactTokensForTokensUniV3(
        address[] memory _path,
        uint24[] memory _fees,
        uint256 _amountIn,
        uint256 _minAmountOut,
        ISwapRouter _uniV3Router
    )
        private
        returns (uint256)
    {
        require(_path.length == _fees.length + 1, "ExchangeIssuance: PATHS_FEES_MISMATCH");
        _safeApprove(IERC20(_path[0]), address(_uniV3Router), _amountIn);
        if(_path.length == 2){
            ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params =
                ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams({
                    tokenIn: _path[0],
                    tokenOut: _path[1],
                    fee: _fees[0],
                    recipient: address(this),
                    deadline: block.timestamp,
                    amountIn: _amountIn,
                    amountOutMinimum: _minAmountOut,
                    sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
                });
            return _uniV3Router.exactInputSingle(params);
        } else {
            bytes memory pathV3 = _encodePathV3(_path, _fees, false);
            ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params =
                ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
                    path: pathV3,
                    recipient: address(this),
                    deadline: block.timestamp,
                    amountIn: _amountIn,
                    amountOutMinimum: _minAmountOut
                });
            uint amountOut = _uniV3Router.exactInput(params);
            return amountOut;
        }
    }
```
In both the functions,  the deadline parameter is simply passed in as current block.timestamp in which transaction occurs. This effectively means that transaction has no deadline, which means that swap transaction may be included anytime by validators and remain pending in mempool, potentially exposing users to sandwich attacks by attackers or MEV bots.

 Consider the following general scenerio that is also applicable to the protocol here:

Alice wants to swap 30 vBNB token for 1 BNB and later sell the 1 BNB for 300 DAI. She signs the transaction calling RiskFund.swapPoolsAsset() with inputAmount = 30 vBNB and amountOutmin = 0.99 BNB to allow for 1% slippage.

2. The transaction is submitted to the mempool, however, Alice chose a transaction fee that is too low for validators to be interested in including her transaction in a block. The transaction stays pending in the mempool for extended periods, which could be hours, days, weeks, or even longer.
3. When the average gas fee dropped far enough for Alice's transaction to become interesting again for miners to include it, her swap will be executed. In the meantime, the price of BNB could have drastically decreased. She will still at least get 0.99 BNB due to `amountOutmin`, but the DAI value of that output might be significantly lower. She has unknowingly performed a bad trade due to the pending transaction she forgot about.
An even worse way this issue can be maliciously exploited is through MEV:

The swap transaction is still pending in the mempool. Average fees are still too high for validators to be interested in it. The price of BNB has gone up significantly since the transaction was signed, meaning Alice would receive a lot more ETH when the swap is executed. But that also means that her minOutput value is outdated and would allow for significant slippage.

2. A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated `minOut` now allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches Alice, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for Alice.


## Impact
Potential reverts, MEV and sandwich attacks.

## Recommendation
Use some decent deadline, instead of block.timestamp.
