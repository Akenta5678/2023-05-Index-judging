# soiled assets will lead to a DOS in the lever function

## Summary
soiled assets will lead to a DOS in the lever function
## Vulnerability Detail
https://docs.aave.com/developers/whats-new/siloed-borrowing
> This feature allow assets with potentially manipulatable oracles (for example illiquid Uni V3 pairs) to be listed on Aave as single borrow asset. This means that if an asset is configured as siloed, it can't be borrowed in a position at the same time as with other assets. This helps mitigating the risk associated with such assets from impacting the overall solvency of the protocol. This condition can be found in the codebase here.

the quote is from the link above. As we can see an admin from aave can decide if an asset is soiled, and this is a problem because the protocol does not account for this fact.

1. suppose there are three collateral asset,
2. asset A and asset B and asset C
3. suddenly asset B is listed as a soiled asset by AAVE admin
4. all lever function would revert

```solidity
function lever(
        ISetToken _setToken,
        IERC20 _borrowAsset,
        IERC20 _collateralAsset,
        uint256 _borrowQuantityUnits,
        uint256 _minReceiveQuantityUnits,
        string memory _tradeAdapterName, // exchange name
        bytes memory _tradeData
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyManagerAndValidSet(_setToken)
    {
        // For levering up, send quantity is derived from borrow asset and receive quantity is derived from 
        // collateral asset
        ActionInfo memory leverInfo = _createAndValidateActionInfo(
            _setToken,
            _borrowAsset,
            _collateralAsset,
            _borrowQuantityUnits,
            _minReceiveQuantityUnits,
            _tradeAdapterName,
            true
        );

        // @audit
        _borrow(leverInfo.setToken, leverInfo.lendingPool, leverInfo.borrowAsset, leverInfo.notionalSendQuantity);

        uint256 postTradeReceiveQuantity = _executeTrade(leverInfo, _borrowAsset, _collateralAsset, _tradeData);

        uint256 protocolFee = _accrueProtocolFee(_setToken, _collateralAsset, postTradeReceiveQuantity);

        uint256 postTradeCollateralQuantity = postTradeReceiveQuantity.sub(protocolFee);

        _deposit(leverInfo.setToken, leverInfo.lendingPool, _collateralAsset, postTradeCollateralQuantity);

        _updateLeverPositions(leverInfo, _borrowAsset);

        emit LeverageIncreased(
            _setToken,
            _borrowAsset,
            _collateralAsset,
            leverInfo.exchangeAdapter,
            leverInfo.notionalSendQuantity,
            postTradeCollateralQuantity,
            protocolFee
        );
    }
```
because the function `lever` must first borrow, if it has a soiled asset, the function will always revert
## Impact
because a user has a soiled asset, they cannot call the lever function. Being unable to call this function when market is favorable for user will lose him out on potential gains if he were to have levered up. This is a loss of funds for the user

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we recommend the project account for the potential soiled assets
