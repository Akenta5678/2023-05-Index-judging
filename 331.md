# Wrong modifier is being used in interactManager() function

## Summary
`onlyExtension` modifier is being used instead of `onlyAdapter` modifier in interactManager() function

## Vulnerability Detail
The `interactManager()` function in `BaseManagerV2.sol` has a discrepancy between the comments and its implementation. According to the comments, the function should only be called by `onlyAdapter`. However, the code uses the `onlyExtension` modifier instead of the correct `onlyAdapter` modifier. This incorrect modifier allows unintended individuals to invoke the function, potentially leading to unforeseen consequences and unexpected behavior.


## Impact
This inconsistency raises concerns about the security and integrity of the contract. If unauthorized entities can access and interact with the manager through this function, it could result in unintended actions and even loss of funds.
