# RemoveModule in AMM module does not check if there is outstanding liquidity in an AMM

## Summary
The function remove module in AMMmodule.sol. removes a module from the protocol. However, the module involves investing user funds in AMM pools, and with no check to make sure that all liquidity has been removed. 



## Vulnerability Detail

The function remove module removes a module from the protocol. However, the module has several functions that allows the manager to add and remove liquidity to AMM pools shown here.

However, the function removeModule does not remove liquidity.

So there could be a situation where liquidity is added and then Removemodule is called leaving funds stranded in various AMM protocols. This could be a problem when interacting with a protocol like uniswap where after adding liquidity, a settoken contract is given an NFT as a representation of the LP position. If removemodule is called and a user tries to redeem tokens, then there may be an accounting error where users are receiving less collateral than they should receive.



## Impact

Accounting error when removemodule is called

## Recommendation

Add check to make sure that all liquidity is removed before removing a module when using an AMM module
