# The mutualUpgrade hash does not expire or allow cancellation by signer

## Summary

The mutualUpgrade modifier allows two signers to approve a transaction by setting the mutualUpgrades hash to true. However, if one signer approves and the other does not, the old approval is not deleted and could be used in the future without the consent of the first signer.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a signer wants to approve a transaction, it calls a function with the `mutualUpgrade` modifier. This modifier checks if the other signer has already approved the same transaction by hashing the msg.data and the non-caller address. If not, it sets the mutualUpgrades hash to true for the msg.data and the caller address.

        modifier mutualUpgrade(address _signerOne, address _signerTwo) {
            require(
                msg.sender == _signerOne || msg.sender == _signerTwo,
                "Must be authorized address"
            );

            address nonCaller = _getNonCaller(_signerOne, _signerTwo);

            // The upgrade hash is defined by the hash of the transaction call data and sender of msg,
            // which uniquely identifies the function, arguments, and sender.
            bytes32 expectedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.data, nonCaller));

            if (!mutualUpgrades[expectedHash]) {
                bytes32 newHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.data, msg.sender));

                mutualUpgrades[newHash] = true;

                emit MutualUpgradeRegistered(newHash);

                return;
            }

            delete mutualUpgrades[expectedHash];

            // Run the rest of the upgrades
            _;
        }

However, in case there is a disagreement and only one party approves, for example signerOne approves but signerTwo does not. After that both agree to a different transaction and approve it again, the previous approval from signerOne is still valid and cannot be cancelled or invalidated. That approval can be used later by signerTwo without signerOneâ€™s awareness.

## Impact

An unused approval can be used by another signer to execute a transaction without the knowledge or consent of the original approver. This breaks the mutual signing requirement of the mutualUpgrade modifier.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an expiry date for each approval or let the signer cancel their approval.
