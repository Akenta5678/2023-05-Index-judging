# XDZIBEC-absorb Function in AirdropExtension Does Not Check Caller's Authority

## Summary

There is a bug in the `absorb` function:
It’s allows anyone to call the `absorb` function and steal any `airdropped tokens`, even if they are not the intended recipient. It’s could lead to financial losses for users of the contract.
This vulnerability could be exploited by malicious actors from an attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail

`absorb`
```solidity 
     */
    function absorb(address _token) external onlyAllowedCaller(msg.sender) {
        invokeManager(
            address(airdropModule),
            abi.encodeWithSignature("absorb(address,address)", setToken, _token)
        );
    }

    /**
     * OPERATOR ONLY: batch absorbs airdropped tokens
     *
     * @param _tokens   List of airdropped tokens to absorb
     */
```

the `absorb` function does not check whether the `caller` is the `owner` of the contract. This means that anyone can call this `function` and `absorb` any `airdropped` `tokens`, even if they are not the intended recipient.
The vulnerability  is caused by a lack of authorization checking in the absorb function.
If an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by malicious actors is leading to steal airdropped tokens from users of the contract.


## Impact

The bug is a serious security issue, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by malicious actors  that could lead to financial losses for users of the contract and  it’s leading to steal airdropped tokens from users of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-the `absorb` function should be `updated` to check the owner of the contract before allowing anyone to call it and ensure that only the owner of the contract can call the `absorb` function and `absorb` any `airdropped tokens`.
