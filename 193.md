# XO-Lack of Balance Check in invokeWrapWETH() Function Leads to Out of Gas Error

## Summary
- The `invokeWrapWETH` function does not check to see if the user has enough `ETH` to `wrap`. This could lead to a user losing their `ETH` if they try to wrap more `ETH` than they have.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 /**
     * Instructs the SetToken to wrap the passed quantity of ETH
     *
     * @param _setToken        SetToken instance to invoke
     * @param _weth            WETH address
     * @param _quantity        The quantity to unwrap
     */
    function invokeWrapWETH(ISetToken _setToken, address _weth, uint256 _quantity) internal {
        bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSignature("deposit()");
        _setToken.invoke(_weth, _quantity, callData);
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability  in the line that calls the `deposit()` function on the `SetToken` contract. The `deposit()` function requires that the user have a balance of `ETH` in their` wallet`, but the `invokeWrapWETH()` function does not check to see if the user has enough `ETH`. This means that a user could call the `invokeWrapWETH()` function and pass in a quantity of `ETH` that they do not have, which would result in an `Out of Gas error`, this leading users to losing their ETH if they try to wrap more ETH than they have
## Impact
- An example :
  1 - Alice wants to wrap 1 ETH.
  2 - She calls the `invokeWrapWETH` function and passes in a quantity of 1 ETH.
  3 - The `invokeWrapWETH` function does not check to see if Alice has enough ETH.
  4 -  Alice does not have enough ETH.
  5 -  The `invokeWrapWETH` function fails and Alice loses her ETH.
- The vulnerability lead to Alice losing her ETH

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `invokeWrapWETH()` function should be updated to check to see if the user has enough `ETH` before calling the `deposit()` function.
- The `invokeWrapWETH` function could be updated to throw an error if the user does not have enough `ETH`.
