# Some modules will not work with certain ERC20s reverting when trying to approve with allowance already >0

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens like USDT require resetting the approval to 0 first before being able to reset it to another value.
## Vulnerability Detail
There are multiple files where using invokeApprove without resetting approve to 0.
There was 1 module where it was [fixed before](https://github.com/ckoopmann/set-protocol-v2/issues/3)
>Proposed Mitigation: Resetting allowance to 0 after every mint / redeem. This should also fix the issue of certain ERC20s reverting when trying to approve with allowance already >0
 
 Here are files.
```solidity
    function _executeComponentApprovals(ActionInfo memory _actionInfo) internal {
        address spender = _actionInfo.ammAdapter.getSpenderAddress(_actionInfo.liquidityToken);

        // Loop through and approve total notional tokens to spender
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _actionInfo.components.length ; i++) {
            _actionInfo.setToken.invokeApprove(
                _actionInfo.components[i],
                spender,
                _actionInfo.totalNotionalComponents[i]
            );
        }
    }

```

## Impact
Some modules will not work with certain ERC20s and there might be residual allowance left just like in this [issue](https://github.com/ckoopmann/set-protocol-v2/issues/3)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reset to 0 in those modules so certain ERC20 will work without problems
