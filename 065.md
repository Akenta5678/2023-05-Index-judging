# Anybody can create new setTokens which could cause a DoS when enough setTokens have been added to the controller.sets[] array

## Summary
Anybody can create new setTokens which could cause a DoS when enough setTokens have been added to the [controller.sets[] array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/Controller.sol#L66-L67)

## Vulnerability Detail
- The creation of real setTokens can be compromised by malicious actors whose intentions are to cause damage to the protocol
- The cost of causing the DoS will be the same as the cost to revert it. Yes, the protocol can remove the fake setTokens, but the cost of removing the fake setTokens will be similar to the cost of causing the DoS.
- A malicious third party who might gain some benefit by causing DoS to the protocol might be willing to absorb the costs if the end goal is not directly gaining an economic incentive from the DoS, but any other type of benefit such as causing a bad reputation of the Index protocol.

## Impact
Causing a DoS on the protocol to add real setTokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an  Access Control to limit the creation of new setTokens to only authorized parties
