# Removing an enabled borrow asset can be denied

## Summary
A malicious user can front-run the tx and send as little as 1 wei of the borrowAsset into the setToken contract, which will make the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveLeverageModule.sol#L630) to revert, which will cause the removal of the borrowed asset impossible as long as the malicious user continues to front-run the tx to remove the borrowedAsset

## Vulnerability Detail
-  Even though the administrators send a tx to repay the leftover debt before sending the tx to remove the enabled borrowed asset, the malicious user can order the tx so when the tx to remove the borrowed asset is executed, the leftover debt is != 0
- A malicious user can front-run the tx and send as little as 1 wei of the borrowAsset into the setToken contract, which will make the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveLeverageModule.sol#L630) to revert, which will cause the removal of the borrowed asset impossible as long as the malicious user continues to front-run the tx to remove the borrowedAsset

## Impact
A malicious user can front-run the tx and send as little as 1 wei of the borrowAsset into the setToken contract, which will cause the removal of the borrowed asset to fail

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is to make sure the [`removeBorrowAssets()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveLeverageModule.sol#L624-L636)  is capable of repaying any leftover debt (if there is any), instead of assuming that the remaining debt is 0.
