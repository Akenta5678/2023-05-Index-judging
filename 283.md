# A user calls `ripcord()` to get rewards, but may actually get nothing under certain circumstances

## Summary

In `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol` we have `ripcord()` function:
```solidity
function ripcord(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA {
        LeverageInfo memory leverageInfo = _getAndValidateLeveragedInfo(
            incentive.incentivizedSlippageTolerance,
            exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].incentivizedTwapMaxTradeSize,
            _exchangeName
        );

        // Use the exchangeLastTradeTimestamp so it can ripcord quickly with multiple exchanges
        _validateRipcord(leverageInfo, exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].exchangeLastTradeTimestamp);

        ( uint256 chunkRebalanceNotional, ) = _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional(leverageInfo, methodology.maxLeverageRatio, false);

        _delever(leverageInfo, chunkRebalanceNotional);

        _updateRipcordState(_exchangeName);

        uint256 etherTransferred = _transferEtherRewardToCaller(incentive.etherReward);

        emit RipcordCalled(
            leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio,
            methodology.maxLeverageRatio,
            chunkRebalanceNotional,
            etherTransferred
        );
    }
```

This function is intended to reduce the leverage ratio back to the maximum leverage ratio when the current leverage ratio exceeds a certain threshold. This function can be triggered by anyone, but only by externally owned accounts (EOAs).
The caller of ripcord() will receive a reward in Ether.

Particular attention should be paid when the function calls out `_transferEtherRewardToCaller`:

```solidity
392: uint256 etherTransferred = _transferEtherRewardToCaller(incentive.etherReward);
```

## Vulnerability Detail
`_transferEtherRewardToCaller`:
```solidity
function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) internal returns(uint256) {
        uint256 etherToTransfer = _etherReward < address(this).balance ? _etherReward : address(this).balance;
  
        msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer); 
  
        return etherToTransfer;
    }
```

This function transfers ETH reward to the caller of the ripcord function. If the ETH balance on this contract is less than the required incentive quantity, then transfer the contract balance instead to prevent reverts.

Now let's imagine the following situation as the numbers are just an example:

- Alice calls `ripcord()` in order to receive rewards
- `ripcord()` calls `_transferEtherRewardToCaller()`
- The `_transferEtherRewardToCaller()` calculates that there are fewer ETH rewards in the contract than Alice should receive. Let's say Alice should receive 5 ETH and there are 4 ETH in the contract.
- And in this situation sends the entire ether balance of the contract.

And here come the two possible scenarios.
- It is possible for an Operator to see Alice's transaction in mempool and call [withdrawEtherBalanc()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L580-L585) before Alice's transaction finishes and withdraw all ETH balance from the contract.
```solidity
function withdrawEtherBalance() external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance); 
    }
```
- But let's say the Operator will never do that. The exact same situation is likely to become completely accidental. And Alice will get 0 ETH. 

## Impact

A user calls `ripcord()` to get ETH rewards but gets nothing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

You can check if the contract balance is 0 to revert the transaction because `withdrawEtherBalance()` withdraw all Ether from the contract. The other variant is to refactor `_transferEtherRewardToCaller` if the rewards are more than the contract balance to revert the transaction.
