# Index Coop is vulnerable to attackers sending LTV = 0 collateral tokens, supply/supplyCollateral, bor- row and liquidate operations could stop working

## Summary
If a A-Token with LTV==0 is sent to index coop by a malicious user, all the functionalities will halt.
## Vulnerability Detail
When an AToken has LTV = 0, Aave restricts the usage of some operations. In particular, if the user
owns at least one AToken as collateral that has LTV = 0, these operations could revert
1) Withdraw: if the asset withdrawn is collateral, the user is borrowing something, the operation will revert if the
withdrawn collateral is an AToken with LTV > 0
2) Transfer: if the from is using the asset as collateral, is borrowing something and the asset transferred is an
AToken with LTV > 0 the operation will revert
3) Set the reserve of an AToken as not collateral: if the AToken you are trying to set as non-collateral is an
AToken with LTV > 0 the operation will revert

In the attack scenario, the bad actor could simply supply an underlying that is associated with an LTV = 0 AToken
and transfer it to the Index Coop contract. If the victim does not own any balance of the asset, it will be set as collateral
and the victim will suffer from all the side effects previously explained.
While a "normal" Aave user could simply withdraw, transfer or set that asset as non-collateral, Index Coop, with the
current implementation, cannot do it. Because of the impossibility to remove from the Index Coop wallet the "poisoned
AToken", all the mechanics of index coop will break.

## Impact
Above scenerio will have the following impact
1. User will not be able to withdraw, hence cannot de-leverage
2. User will not be able to borrow any asset, hence cannot leverage.
3. Whole mechanism will break, there could be unexpected, liquidation.
4. User will not be able to withdraw if they wanted to.

In short whole system will be doomed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One probable solution could be to devise a mechanism to remove such poisoned token, probably through the DAO to prevent the centralization risk
