# Every settings in AaveLeverageStrategyExtension is configured by onlyOperator including methodology

## Summary
Based on [discord message](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1109133391904915557/1111458670199447603) and [docs](https://docs.indexcoop.com/index-coop-community-handbook/products/flexible-leverage-indices#what-is-the-methodology-behind-fli) methodologist has an important role of controlling parameters that defines a strategy. There's also an `onlyMethodologist` modifier in the BaseExtension contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
`onlyMethodologist` is not used for any settings including `setMethodologySettings` for setting `methodology`. All the settings are configured by operator.

## Impact
operator could changed the configuration from methodologist specification by calling functions like `setMethodologySettings`.
