# Solidity 0.6.10 version is using in `ClaimModule.sol`, integer overflow or underflow may happen

## Summary
Solidity 0.6.10 version is using in `ClaimModule.sol` which does not imported SafeMath against integer overflow or underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
Even through the `AddressArrayUtils` library has been imported, the library does not provide any safeguards against integer overflow or underflow. It is a utility library for manipulating arrays of addresses.

Based on the code e.g `emit RewardClaimed(_setToken, _rewardPool, adapter, finalRewardsBalance.sub(initRewardsBalance));`. There is a calculation, the `sub()` is from AddressArrayUtils which does not provide any safeguards against integer overflow or underflow.

## Impact
Integer overflow or underflow may happen
