# Wrong calculation of `getPriceUSD` in StableOracleDAI.sol due to incorrect assumption that Chainlink DAI/ETH decimals will return 8 instead of 18

## Summary
`getPriceUSD` is incorrectly calculated because the chainlink DAI/ETH returns the result in 18 decimals instead of 8

## Vulnerability Detail
In the StableOracleDAI.sol contract, the `getPriceUSD` is calculated using the following:-

```solidity
function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        // code...

        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

        @audit-issue - 1e10 multiplied again with 1e18 from `price`
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
    }

```
The `price` from the `priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();` is returned with 18 decimals. However, the protocol incorrectly assumes it to be 8 decimals and then in the return statement, they multiply the price with 1e10.

## Impact
Here the price calculated will be lower than the expected value since the value is divided by 1e10. This can cause wrong calculation of the Oracle prices and can cause 2 problems.
1. When `mintForToken()` is called by a user, they may get less/zero amount of USSD tokens minted when using DAI as collateral
2. Incorrect calculation of `collateralFactor()` which is called by the USSDRebalancer.sol contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the multiplying of 1e10 with price from chainlink feed in the `getPriceUSD()` function
