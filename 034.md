# Unsafe use of transfer()/transferFrom() with IERC20

## Summary

Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

For example, Tether (USDT)'s transfer() and transferFrom() functions on L1 do not return booleans as the specification requires, and instead have no return value. 

## Impact

When these sorts of tokens are cast to IERC20, their [function signatures](https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca) do not match and therefore the calls made, revert (see [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/2b00a32e8f0559e8f386ea4f1800abc5) link for a test case).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20's safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom() instead
