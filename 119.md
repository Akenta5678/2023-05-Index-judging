# Missing function resolve fees in debtissuancemodulev2.

## Summary

Resolve fees function is intended to check if there are any manager fees in the process of issuance or redemption on _debtissuancemodulev2_  . If so it mints sets to the fee recipient with the amount of manager fee . however this function is missing.

## Vulnerability Detail

issue

_resolveEquityPositions(_setToken, quantityWithFees, _to, true, components, equityUnits, initialSetSupply, finalSetSupply);
            _resolveDebtPositions(_setToken, quantityWithFees, true, components, debtUnits, initialSetSupply, finalSetSupply);
            _resolveFees(_setToken, managerFee, protocolFee);
        }
redeem

            _resolveDebtPositions(_setToken, quantityNetFees, false, components, debtUnits, initialSetSupply, finalSetSupply);
            _resolveEquityPositions(_setToken, quantityNetFees, _to, false, components, equityUnits, initialSetSupply, finalSetSupply);
            _resolveFees(_setToken, managerFee, protocolFee);
        }
Both the functions issue and redeem in _debtissuancemodulev2_ are intended to call resolve  fees function to check whether there are any manager fees and if so , mint sets to the fee recipient together with the protocol fees as in the case with _debtissuancemodule.sol_ .

## Impact

If there are manager fees and protocol fees sets will not be minted to the fee recipient.
