# Protocol can fall into situation that ripcord reward are all drained

## Summary

When the difference between collateralValue and borrowValue goes small, the `ripcord` can be called infinitely.


## Vulnerability Detail

Let's assume this scenario:
Setting: 1 eth = 1000 usdc, initialCollateral 1 eth, targetLeverageRatio: 1.8, LTV 0.8, IncentivedRatio: 2
-> borrow 800 usdc and swap into 0.8 eth and deposit all.
== Position is 1.8 eth equity, 800 usdc debt ==
Now eth price went down, 1.8 eth = 1010 usdc
currentLeverateRatio = 1010 / (1010-800) = 4.80
-> ripcord
maxBorrowInUsdc = 1010 * 0.8 - 800 = 8
== Position is 1.785 eth equity, 792 usdc debt, currentLeverageRatio: 4.77 ==
-> ripcord
...

## Impact

Price of assets changes dramatically for many external reasons and this situation is not "hardly happening" one.
- To fully adjust ratio to safe level, it might need to take even hundreds of ripcord action. This means "Denial of service" of whole protocol due to incentivizedTwapCooldownPeriod.
- Rewards are sent same amount everytime of ripcord while the it can only decrease ratio very small amount. It could lead to very inefficient loss of eth.

```solidity
    function ripcord(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA {
        LeverageInfo memory leverageInfo = _getAndValidateLeveragedInfo(
            incentive.incentivizedSlippageTolerance,
            exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].incentivizedTwapMaxTradeSize,
            _exchangeName
        );

        // Use the exchangeLastTradeTimestamp so it can ripcord quickly with multiple exchanges
        _validateRipcord(leverageInfo, exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].exchangeLastTradeTimestamp);

        ( uint256 chunkRebalanceNotional, ) = _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional(leverageInfo, methodology.maxLeverageRatio, false);

        _delever(leverageInfo, chunkRebalanceNotional);

        _updateRipcordState(_exchangeName);

        uint256 etherTransferred = _transferEtherRewardToCaller(incentive.etherReward);

        emit RipcordCalled(
            leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio,
            methodology.maxLeverageRatio,
            chunkRebalanceNotional,
            etherTransferred
        );
    }

```solidity
    function _calculateCurrentLeverageRatio(
        uint256 _collateralValue,
        uint256 _borrowValue
    )
        internal
        pure

    {
        return _collateralValue.preciseDiv(_collateralValue.sub(_borrowValue));
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As Ripcord is emergency situation, we can/should
- remove incentivizedTwapCooldownPeriod
- iterate ripcord until it gets to maxRatio or can't delever any more.

Or we can make new function iterateRipcord with onlyOperator for these cases specifically
