# protocol would fails to delever without flashloan when the collateral value falls short of the LTV requirement

## Summary
protocol would fails to delever without flashloan when the collateral value falls short of the LTV requirement

## Vulnerability Detail
With reference to [ETH Strat](https://indexcoop.com/products/interest-compounding-eth-index), consider a case of ETH strategy of -175% ETH + 275% stETH with targeted 2.75 leverage. The aave-v3 LTV of wstETH is 68.5%, and liquidation threshold is 79.5% with [eMode disabled](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3). 

When stETH is fully pegged to ETH, then the protocol has a health factor of 275 * 0.795 / 175 = 1.249.

When stETH depegs, leading to an increase in leverage, the protocol needs to sell off stETH to bring down the leverage; However since the LTV of stETH is only 68.5%, that means stETH cannot be withdrawn, when stETH price drops to 0.929. 
(The maths comes in this way: 275 * 0.929 => 175) When `collateral * LTV <= borrowed asset`, withdrawal of collateral is disabled in aave. (health factor is still above 1 so the position is free from liquidation.)

Normal withdrawal path would not be possible due to collateral value falls under LTV requirement now

In this scenario, the protocol can only delever though the use of flashloan:
1. Flashloan some ETH, deposit in the position to increase the LTV
2. withdraw the required amount of wstETH, sell-off to ETH.
3. Withdraw the difference in ETH needed, return the flashloan plus flashloan premium.

## Impact
protocol would fails to delever without flashloan when the withdrawal amount exceeds the LTV requirement

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider add a delever path that uses flashloan when the traditional withdrawal fails.
