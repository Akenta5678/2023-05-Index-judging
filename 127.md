# Chainlink may return stale price when L2 sequencer is down

## Summary

Chainlink may return stale price when L2 sequencer is down

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the audit description, index will be deployed on L2 Optimism and Arbitrum.     
From [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds), If a sequencer becomes unavailable, ChainlinkAggregator may return stale price.         

Note that It is a different issue from checking oracle price freshness.        
Because in the case of sharp price fluctuations, the price may be updated several times, although the final price is in freshness, but it may not be the latest price.     

## Impact

Medium. Collateral and borrow values may be miscalculated, affecting user funds. Malicious users can use price differentials to arbitrage.
