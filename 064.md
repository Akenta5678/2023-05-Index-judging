# Can't disengage strategies if the collateral's pool has not enough liquidity

## Summary
A malicious third party could cause a DoS to disengage strategies and decrease the leverage or close the position on Aave by forcing no liquidity on the pool by frontrunning tx to disengage and [borrowing the entire pool reserves](https://medium.com/aave/understanding-the-risks-of-aave-43334dbfc6d0#:~:text=This%20situation%20can%20be%20problematic%20if%20depositors%20wish%20to%20withdraw%20their%20liquidity%2C%20but%20no%20funds%20are%20available.)

## Vulnerability Detail
- The logic to disengage strategies and repay the loans is to [withdraw() the collateral from Aave](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveLeverageModule.sol#L338), and then exchange it for the repayAsset and then repay the debt.

- **AAVE, by design, will lend out all of its reserves, meaning that the amount lent out should not be assumed as liquid.**

- The problem is that an attacker can deny this operation [by borrowing all reserves from AAVE](https://medium.com/aave/understanding-the-risks-of-aave-43334dbfc6d0#:~:text=This%20situation%20can%20be%20problematic%20if%20depositors%20wish%20to%20withdraw%20their%20liquidity%2C%20but%20no%20funds%20are%20available.).
- By borrowing all the reserves from Aave, the withdrawal will fail and the tx to disengage the strategy will be reverted
  - **In a market turndown this can quickly turn open strategies to go below their Liquidation Threshold and cause them to be liquidated on Aave.**
  - The attacker can be incentivized to cause the DoS to cause the strategies to be liquidated on Aave, which will end up making the attacker gain all the collateral of these opened strategies and causing the protocol to accrue losses because strategies were not able to be disengaged
    - The attack can be performed maliciously without the need for a front-run, a sandwich (front-run + back-run) will just make it less costly (less interest paid) for the attacker.

## Impact
By causing a DoS to disengage strategies if the collateral's pool has not had enough liquidity, which could end up causing the positions to be liquidated on Aave

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Think about adding a safeguard path in case the pool has no liquidity. Instead of making the disengage() revert if there is no liquidity, force it to follow the safeguard path.
- The safeguard path could implement a functionality to allow the caller to transfer the amount of tokens required to disengage the strategy, by allowing the caller to transfer the required tokens to repay the debt, the fact that the pool has no liquidity won't prevent the disengage tx to be executed, which will end up reducing the probabilities of an attacker to forcing the pool running out of liquidity.
