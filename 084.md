# onlyEOA modifier that ensures call is from EOA address might not hold true in the future(EIP 3074)

## Summary
modifier onlyEOA is used to ensure calls are only made from EOA. However, EIP 3074 suggests that using onlyEOA modifier to ensure calls are only from Externally owned Account(EOA) address might not hold true.

## Vulnerability Detail
For onlyEOA, tx.origin is used to ensure that the caller is from an EOA and not a smart contract.

In BaseExtension.sol, onlyEOA() modifier is given as below,

```solidity
File: contracts/lib/BaseExtension.sol

59    modifier onlyEOA() {
60        require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
61        _;
62    }
```

However, according to [EIP 3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074#abstract),

This EIP introduces two EVM instructions AUTH and AUTHCALL. The first sets a context variable authorized based on an ECDSA signature. The second sends a call as the authorized account. This essentially delegates control of the externally owned account (EOA) to a smart contract.

Therefore, using tx.origin to ensure msg.sender is an EOA will not hold true in the event EIP 3074 goes through.

## Impact
Using modifier onlyEOA to ensure calls are made only from EOA will not hold true in the event EIP 3074 goes through.

## Code Snippet
Following smart contract functions are using onlyEOA modifier,

In AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol contract, rebalance() function is given as shown  below,

```solidity
File:  contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol

304     function rebalance(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA onlyAllowedCaller(msg.sender) {
```

In AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol contract, iterateRebalance() function is given as shown  below,

```solidity
File:  contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol

338    function iterateRebalance(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA onlyAllowedCaller(msg.sender) {
```

In AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol contract, ripcord() function is given as shown  below,

```solidity
File:  contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol

376    function ripcord(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA {
```

Recommend using OpenZeppelinâ€™s isContract function

*Note that there are edge cases like contract in constructor that can bypass this and hence caution is required when using this. *

For example:

```solidity

+   error NOT_EOA(address from);

    modifier onlyEOA() {
-        require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
+               if (isContract(msg.sender))
+                revert NOT_EOA(msg.sender);
        _;
    }
```
