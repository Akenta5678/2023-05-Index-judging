# slippageTolerance is neglected in the engage() and disengage() function

## Summary
These functions engage(), disengage()  and all externally called functions within them fail to check the slippageTolerance within a require statement / if statement. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a default slippageTolerance set in the constructor by manager. 

The issue is that the default slippageTolerance set by the manager is used to calculate some things within the engage() and disengage() functions but the engage(), disengage() functions and all externally called functions within them fail to check the slippageTolerance within a require statement / if statement.

Since the slippageTolerance is "% in precise units to price min token receive amount from trade quantities" these functions are supposed to check and ensure with a require statement that the receive amount from trade quantities isn't below/ less than the slippageTolerance set by the manager.

## Impact
there can be slippage when operator uses engage() and disengage() functions

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure with a require statement that the slippageTolerance is checked within these functions.
