# DOS due to the use of deprecated function

## Summary:Most action calls  will always revert

## Vulnerability Detail:AaveLeverageStrategyExtension that implements Index strategy for FLI tokens.The function createActionInfo ()  fetches/prepare latest data before new actions are taken.The bug comes in  play 
when getting the prices of Collateral and Borrow, it utilizes chainlink deprecated function latestAnswer(), which unfortunately doesâ€™nt revert instead it returns 0.This contract would revert in an attempt to convert the price to Uint256(conversion from int=>uint does not support 0 as an input in Openzeppelin safeCast).
This internal function _createActionInfo() is called to initialize the leverage Ratio and other functions would revert because of dependency in the uninstialized leverageRatio.
int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer()
rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);


## Impact:Bots,contracts and users would not be able to interact with functions in the contract,which is eventually a DOS scenario

## Recommendation:Uses chainlink latestdata() instead of latestAnswer
