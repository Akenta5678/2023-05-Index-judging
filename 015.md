# ripcord uses a static slippageTolerance while being a last-resort measure is unlikely to work

## Summary
ripcord uses a static slippageTolerance while being a last-resort measure is unlikely to work

## Vulnerability Detail
ripcord allows a 1-time deleverage attempt to sell off collateral in an attempt to respond to volatile market situation, when the leverage hits above the incentivized leverage ratio.

However, the static incentivized slippageTolerance from the system is applied to the price from chainlink during ripcord. This is unlikely to work during a volatile market condition. 

## Impact
likelihood of ripcord as a last-resort function fails to salvage the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider a progressive slippage tolerance if ripcord fails in a previous attempt. An cache variable similar to the twapLeverageRatio can be implemented to record `ripcordFailedAttempt`. Final Slippage Tolerance can be like:

```solidity
uint256 slippageTolerance = _leverageInfo.slippageTolerance + ripcordFailedAttempt * slippageIncreaseInterval
```

where `slippageIncreaseInterval` is an system configuration (10bp 20bp etc)
and ripcordFailedAttempt is a cached frequency of previous failed ripcord call and would be set to 0 at the end of a successful ripcord.
