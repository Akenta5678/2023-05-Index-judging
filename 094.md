# Extensions can be added in Emergencies

## Summary

Ideally whenever `emergencies > 0` , No extension can be added. However there is a bypass, using which extensions can be added even in emergencies.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [BaseManagerV2.sol#addExtension()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L228-L233) function has a modifier `upgradesPermitted` applied which makes sure that user can proceed with the function only if `emergencies == 0` . This means that no extension can be added even if there is 1 emergency.

However, [authorizeExtension()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L258-L268) is able to add extensions even in emergencies, which should not be allowed as explained above.

`authorizeExtension()` calls [_authorizeExtension()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L579) which further calls [_addExtension()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L535-L541) to add an extension if it is not already added.

It is nowhere checked whether `emergencies==0` or not.

Also assume a scenario:

1. **Methodologist** calls `authorizeExtension()` . `authorizeExtension` will still not execute as it has to be run by the **Operator** as well
2. Now there is some emergency and `emergencies ` count is incremented to 1
3. `addExtension()` and `authorizeExtension()` are both able to add extensions just by the operator. However since an emergency exists - the `addExtension()` function will revert but `authorizeExtension()` will add an extension even in emergency


## Impact

Extensions can be added even in emergencies

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`upgradesPermitted` should be applied to the internal function: `_addExtension()`

```solidity
    function _addExtension(address _extension) upgradesPermitted internal {
        extensions.push(_extension);

        isExtension[_extension] = true;

        emit ExtensionAdded(_extension);
    }
```
