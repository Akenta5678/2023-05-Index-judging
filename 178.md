# Lack of Checks in SetTokenCreator can Lead to Invalid SetTokens

## Summary

The `create()` function in `SetTokenCreator.sol` doesn't properly validate the input it receives. Particularly, it fails to check whether the addresses in `_components` are smart contracts, not normal addresses, which could potentially lead to errors in other functions relying on these addresses being valid smart contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

SetTokenCreator contract has a function named 'create'. The 'create' function does not check for the validity of the `_manager` address. There is no check whether the `_manager` address passed to the `create` function is a contract address or an externally owned address (EOA). If the `_manager` address is a contract, it should be checked whether the contract implements necessary functions that a manager contract should have.

Moreover, there is no check for zero addresses in the `_modules` array. If a zero address is added to the `_modules` array, it could cause an unwanted behavior as zero address is an invalid address in Ethereum.

The create function also lacks the validation for duplicate module addresses in the `_modules` array. The same module can be added multiple times into the `_modules` array which can cause logical errors in other parts of the system.

## Impact

If a malicious actor were to input non-smart contract addresses, it could potentially result in an error or undefined behavior in other functions that interact with the `_components`. This would likely lead to an interruption of the service, and it may expose other vulnerabilities.

## Code Snippet

In `SetTokenCreator.sol`:

```solidity
function create(
    address[] memory _components,
    int256[] memory _units,
    address[] memory _modules,
    address _manager,
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol
)
    external
    returns (address)
{
    require(_components.length > 0, "Must have at least 1 component");
    require(_components.length == _units.length, "Component and unit lengths must be the same");
    require(!_components.hasDuplicate(), "Components must not have a duplicate");
    ...
    // No validation of whether the addresses in _components are smart contracts
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution to this problem would be to add a function that checks whether a given address is a smart contract. This function could be used to validate the input of `_components` in the `create()` function. The proposed changes to the `create()` function are shown below:

```solidity
function create(
    address[] memory _components,
    ...
)
    external
    returns (address)
{
    require(_components.length > 0, "Must have at least 1 component");
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _components.length; i++) {
        require(isContract(_components[i]), "Component must be a smart contract");
    }
    ...
}

function isContract(address _addr) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint32 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(_addr)
    }
    return (size > 0);
}
```

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy `SetTokenCreator.sol` with the current code base.
2. Call the `create()` function with an array of addresses where at least one address is not a smart contract, an invalid `_manager` address, a zero address or duplicate addresses to the `_modules` array
3. Observe that the function does not revert and proceeds to create a `SetToken` with these addresses.
