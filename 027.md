# `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol` does not allow user to specify slippage parameter during rebalance or ripcord

## Summary
`AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol` does not allow user to specify slippage parameter during rebalance or ripcord, which can expose them to sandwich attacks by MEV bots or other users, leading to loss of funds either by repaying more than expected during delevering or receiving lesser than expected collateral asset in the future when levering.

## Vulnerability Detail
Refer to Impact section.

## Impact

`execution.slippageTolerance` can only by set by operator via `setExecutionSettings()`. Hence for allowed users calling `rebalance()`, `iterateRebalance()` or `ripcord`, they can never specify their own slippage parameter

This can lead to the following 3 scenarios:

1. If current leverage ratio greater than new leverage ratio (i.e. `_newLeverageRatio < _leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio`) then rebalance decreases leverage for a given collateral position by withdrawing `_collateralAsset` from Aave and performing a swap, exchanging the `_collateralAsset` for `_repayAsset`. If slippage set by operator is too high or outdated, user can be sandwiched and repay more than expected `_repayAsset` to Aave module as slippage parameter `minRepayUnits` calculated via `_calculateMinRepayUnits()` will be overestimated.

<br/>

2. If current leverage ratio lesser or equal to new leverage ratio (i.e. `_newLeverageRatio >= _leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio`), than rebalance increases leverage for a given collateral position by borrowing `_borrowAsset` from Aave and performing a DEX trade, exchanging the `_borrowAsset `for `_collateralAsset` and depositing `_collateralAsset` to Aave and mints corresponding aToken. If slippage set by operator is too high or outdated, user can be sandwiched and deposit lesser `_collateralAsset` to Aave module as slippage parameter `minReceiveCollateralUnits` calculated via `_calculateMinCollateralReceiveUnits()` will be underestimated, resulting lesser minting of aTokens for withdrawals later.

<br/>

3. Similarly, does not allow user to set `execution.slippageTolerance` when calling `ripcord()` to decrease leverage ratio back to maximum leverage ratio via `_delever()`. Similarly, if slippage set by operator is too high or outdated, user can be sandwiched and repay more than expected `_repayAsset` to Aave module.

Overall, users can lose funds either by repaying more than expected during delevering or receiving lesser than expected collateral asset in the future when levering.

## Recommendation
Allow users to specify their own slippage parameters when calling `rebalance()`, `iterateRebalance()` and `ripcord()`.
