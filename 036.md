# there should be a check to ensure there's allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `_quantity`

## Summary
the transferFrom() in explicitErc20.sol doesn't check to ensure that there's allowance to spend for `from`'s tokens of at least `_quantity`.
## Vulnerability Detail
This is also one of the requirements of OpenZeppelin's implementation of the transferFrom() function.
see here- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/09329f8a18f08df65863a5060f6e776bf7fccacf/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L155-L156

this is to ensure that the caller, spender/to address has allowance from the `from` address to spend a specific amount of his tokens on his behalf(i.e `_quantity` in our case).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement something similar to how OpenZeppelin implemented theirs
```solidity
 function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
        address spender = _msgSender();
        _spendAllowance(from, spender, amount);
        _transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
then the _spendAllowance should be something like this
```solidity
 function _spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(owner, spender);
        if (currentAllowance != type(uint256).max) {
            require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: insufficient allowance");
            unchecked {
                _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - amount);
            }
        }
    }
```
