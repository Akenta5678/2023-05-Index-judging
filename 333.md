# removeExtension should validate if the extension is completely paused

## Summary
While having debt position and even in rebalancing at Extension, the Manager just removes extension from it. It makes later extensions can't start/engage.


## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see Manager.removeModule()
It calls setToken.removeModule() and it calls module.removeModule() to finalize things before being removed.
This tells us that, Operator can call remove functions without enough preparation, by mistake or some other reasons.
But Manager.removeExtension() doesn't have this step and just remove.
Extension can in various situations that can not be removed.
If Extension makes setToken have debt position and it's suddenly removed from module,
then setToken's debtPosition can't be removed as new extension can't even start/engage.


## Impact
Protocol not working
Denial of Service
Locked funds


## Code Snippet
There are many places that remove extension in BaseManagerV2.sol.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L337-L340
```solidity
function removeModule(address _module) external onlyOperator {
    require(!protectedModules[_module].isProtected, "Module protected");
    setToken.removeModule(_module);
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L240-L249
```solidity
function removeExtension(address _extension) external onlyOperator {
    require(isExtension[_extension], "Extension does not exist");
    require(!_isAuthorizedExtension(_extension), "Extension used by protected module");

    extensions.removeStorage(_extension);

    isExtension[_extension] = false;

    emit ExtensionRemoved(_extension);
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol#L286-L287
```solidity
function revokeExtensionAuthorization(address _module, address _extension)
    external
    mutualUpgrade(operator, methodologist)
{
    require(protectedModules[_module].isProtected, "Module not protected");
    require(isExtension[_extension], "Extension does not exist");
    require(protectedModules[_module].authorizedExtensions[_extension], "Extension not authorized");

    protectedModules[_module].authorizedExtensions[_extension] = false;
    protectedModules[_module].authorizedExtensionsList.removeStorage(_extension);

    emit ExtensionAuthorizationRevoked(_module, _extension);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Like removeModule, removeExtension should call extension.removeExtension that does finalization process (e,g disengage).
