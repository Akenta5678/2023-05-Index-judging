# `calculateDefaultEditPositionUnit` could revert in multiple cases which will make functions in `TradeWrapModule.sol` or `WrapModuleV2.sol` not work

## Summary
The function `calculateDefaultEditPositionUnit` from the `Position.sol` contract calculates new position units without picking up airdropped assets, but this function could revert because of an underflow in multiple occasions making most of the important function from `WrapModuleV2.sol` or `TradeModule.sol` unusable.
## Vulnerability Detail
After most of the important actions in `WrapModuleV2.sol` or `TradeModule.sol` the contract would calculate the new position units with the `calculateDefaultEditPositionUnit` by using the `balanceOf` an asset before the action, and after the action. For exemple in the `TradeModule.sol` it uses `balanceOf` the `sendToken` and `receiveToken`, before and after the trade was done https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/TradeModule.sol#L306-L316 or the `WrapModuleV2.sol` it uses the `balanceOf` the wrapped and underlying assets, before and after the wrapping was done https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/WrapModuleV2.sol#L503-L507
The problem occurs if in any of these cases the balances of these assets are 0, before or after since the function `calculateDefaultEditPositionUnit` substract from those balances https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/lib/Position.sol#L256-L257
or if `totalSupply` of the specific `SetToken` is too high making the calculation `_prePositionUnit` * `_setTokenSupply` bigger than the `_preTotalNotional` which will underflow and revert. Even if, `TradeModule.sol`, uses the if statement in the function `calculateAndEditDefaultPosition` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/lib/Position.sol#L215-L225 which checks that the `balanceOf` after the action is greater than 0, it doesn't protect for the `receiveToken` cases, where the `balanceOf` before is lower than `balanceOf` after.
## Impact
The impact is a medium one since it affects the usability of the protocol in some cases

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation would be to use an If statement so in those cases the subtraction would not be made, or take special care for those cases.
