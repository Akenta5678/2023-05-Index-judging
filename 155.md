# Elements could be located very far in the array resulting in DOS due to insufficient gas in `indexOf()`


## Summary

The index protocol contains a function `indexOf()` which is utilized in numerous instances to search for the index of an address or a string within an array. A key concern regarding this is that a there is a potential for high gas costs due to inefficient looping structures, particularly when working with very large arrays, there by causing the attempted loop to find an element/address to fail due to the out of gas error

NB: Protocol still loops over an array that's not limited in size in other functions like [AddressArrayUtils.hasDuplicate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/lib/AddressArrayUtils.sol#L64-L76), but this report would only focus on the issue regarding `indexOf()` since the underlying cause of the issue is the same

## Vulnerability Detail

In the implemented `indexOf()` functions of protocol, there's a loop that goes through each element (string/address) of the array until it finds a match. This could lead to high gas costs if the array is large. Here's the relevant code:

Take a look at this instance of the implementation from [StringArrayUtils.sol:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/lib/StringArrayUtils.sol#L29-L43)

```solidity
function indexOf(string[] memory A, string memory a) internal pure returns (uint256, bool) {
    uint256 length = A.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (keccak256(bytes(A[i])) == keccak256(bytes(a))) {
            return (i, true);
        }
    }
    return (uint256(-1), false);
}
```

Now take a look at the [indexOf](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/lib/AddressArrayUtils.sol#L32-L46) function from AddressArrayUtils.sol

```solidity
    function indexOf(address[] memory A, address a) internal pure returns (uint256, bool) {
        uint256 length = A.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (A[i] == a) {
                return (i, true);
            }
        }
        return (uint256(-1), false);
    }
```

The issue lies in the fact that the functions do not limit the maximum length of the array that can be provided. Consequently, in a scenario where an array of large size is inputted, the iteration could run out of gas, causing the transaction to fail. This is particularly worrying in high load situations, as the size of the arrays may grow beyond control, potentially leading to denial-of-service-like situations due to the transactions running out of gas.

### POC

NB: The following contract demonstrates the potential issue, though being based on only the instance from [StringArrayUtils.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/lib/StringArrayUtils.sol#L29-L43) the idea is the same for all `indexOf()/hasDuplicates()` implementations

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.10;

contract TestContract {
    string[] public A;

    constructor() public {
        // Fill the array with a large number of elements
        for (uint i = 0; i < 1111; i++) {
            A.push("Test");
        }//@audit 1111 is just a special large number picked at random, the array length could be any large number and the test would still pass
    }

    function findElement(string memory a) public view returns (bool) {
        uint256 length = A.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            // Use keccak256 to compare strings
            if (keccak256(bytes(A[i])) == keccak256(bytes(a))) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

```

In the above contract, during the construction, the `A` Array is filled with a large number of elements (1111 in this case). The findElement function is designed to find an element in this array. When you call findElement with any argument, it will loop through the entire largeArray, comparing the keccak256 hash of each string in the array with the keccak256 hash of the input.

For an array of this size, the findElement function would fail due to exceeding the block gas limit. If the array was even larger, it could become practically impossible to call findElement successfully.

Note that the usage of `keccak256()` exarcebates this issue for the case of [StringArrayUtils.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/lib/StringArrayUtils.sol#L29-L43) and would mean that that of `AddressArrayUtils`would be able to take a larger array, but case is still present in both instances.

## Impact

Given the lack of restrictions on the size of the input arrays, there's a high risk for any utilization of this code. If the size of the array is large enough to make a function call exceed the block gas limit, it could render the function unusable, leading to potential concerns about the functionality and reliability of the smart contract system.

## Recommendation

As a best practice, consider introducing a limit to the size of the arrays that can be processed by the functions. Additionally, if possible, utilize data structures that have constant-time (O(1)) search complexity, such as mappings. If these recommendations are not feasible, consider providing mechanisms that can help deal with large arrays in a more efficient manner to avoid potential out-of-gas errors.
