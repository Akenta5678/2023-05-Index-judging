# Excessive asset from trade / swap is not handled well when deleveraging

## Summary

Excess asset from trade / swap is not handled well when deleveraging

## Vulnerability Detail

when doing the deleverage

https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/86be7ee76d9a7e4f7e93acfc533216ebef791c89/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveV3LeverageModule.sol#L313

first, we construct the deleverInfo

```solidity
ActionInfo memory deleverInfo = _createAndValidateActionInfo(
		_setToken,
		_collateralAsset,
		_repayAsset,
		_redeemQuantityUnits,
		_minRepayQuantityUnits,
		_tradeAdapterName,
		false
	);
```

then we withdraw from the lending pool, execute trade and repay the borrow token

```solidity
_withdraw(deleverInfo.setToken, deleverInfo.lendingPool, _collateralAsset, deleverInfo.notionalSendQuantity);

        uint256 postTradeReceiveQuantity = _executeTrade(deleverInfo, _collateralAsset, _repayAsset, _tradeData);

        uint256 protocolFee = _accrueProtocolFee(_setToken, _repayAsset, postTradeReceiveQuantity);

        uint256 repayQuantity = postTradeReceiveQuantity.sub(protocolFee);

        _repayBorrow(deleverInfo.setToken, deleverInfo.lendingPool, _repayAsset, repayQuantity);
```

the issue is that the excessive asset from trade is not handled

the trade received (quantity - the protocol fee) is used to repay the debt

but the required debt to be required is the (borrowed amount + the interest rate)

suppose the only debt that needs to be repayed is 1000 USDC

trade received (quantity - the protocol) fee is 20000 USDC

only 1000 USDC is used to repay the debt

because when repaying, the paybackAmount is only the debt amount

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/29ff9b9f89af7cd8255231bc5faf26c3ce0fb7ce/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L204

```solidity
uint256 paybackAmount = params.interestRateMode == DataTypes.InterestRateMode.STABLE
  ? stableDebt
  : variableDebt;
```

then when burning the variable debt token

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/29ff9b9f89af7cd8255231bc5faf26c3ce0fb7ce/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L224

```solidity
reserveCache.nextScaledVariableDebt = IVariableDebtToken(
	reserveCache.variableDebtTokenAddress
  ).burn(params.onBehalfOf, paybackAmount, reserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex);
```

only the "payback amount", which is 1000 USDC is transferred to pay the debt,

the excessive leftover amount is (20000 USDC - 1000 USDC) = 19000 USDC

which is not handled and never deposit back into the AAVE lending pool

## Impact

the excessive leftover amount after repaying the debt is never deposited into the AAVE lending pool, leads to unhealth position or liquidation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol handle the excessive swapped amount
