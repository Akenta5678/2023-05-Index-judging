# `call()` should be used instead of `transfer()`

## Summary
`transfer()` is deprecated and `call()` is better to use since `call()` doesn't have fixed gas limit of 2300.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transfer()` and `send()` functions forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. However, this limits the AaveLevarageStrategyExtension and AaveV3LevarageStrategyExtension contracts to interact with other contracts that need more than 2300 gas to process the transaction.

## Impact
`transfer()` uses a fixed amount of gas, which can result in a reverted transaction.

## Code Snippet
[- AaveLevarageStrategyExtension.1221](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1221)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the line to the code below
```solidity
        (success, result) = msg.sender.call{value: etherToTransfer}("");
```
