# Protocol incompatibility with Fee-on-transfer/deflationary tokens

## Summary
The issue mechanism in contract `DebtIssuanceModuleV2` doesn't handle fee-on-transfer/deflationary correctly.


## Vulnerability Detail
When the user issues the SetToken, the user's token will be transferred as an underlying asset to the SetToken contract. Then the validation function `validateCollateralizationPostTransferInPreHook()` validates the transferred token.

After the deflationary token is transferred, the protocol will receive a lower amount than expected for validation, resulting in a validation failure.



## Impact
The user will be unable to issue the SetToken with a component that is a fee-on-transfer token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend using balance validation both before and after token transfers in the contract.
