# Lack of consideration when liquidation happens during leverage

## Summary

Lack of consideration when liquidation happens

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/86be7ee76d9a7e4f7e93acfc533216ebef791c89/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveV3LeverageModule.sol#L252

@dev MANAGER ONLY: Increases leverage for a given collateral position using an enabled borrow asset.

this function first borrow asset from lending pool, then swap the borrowed asset to target token and deposit the target token to lending pool as collateral

https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/86be7ee76d9a7e4f7e93acfc533216ebef791c89/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveV3LeverageModule.sol#L313

@dev MANAGER ONLY: Decrease leverage for a given collateral position using an enabled borrow asset.

the protocol try to withdraw from the lending pool and repay the debt
i
such design failed to consider the case when liquidation happens

https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/liquidations

> The health of the Aave Protocol is dependent on the 'health' of the collateralised positions within the protocol, also known as the 'health factor'. When the 'health factor' of an account's total loans is below 1, anyone can make a liquidationCall() to the Pool or L2Pool (in case of Arbitrum/Optimism) contract, pay back part of the debt owed and receive discounted collateral in return (also known as the liquidation bonus).

```solidity
_withdraw(deleverInfo.setToken, deleverInfo.lendingPool, _collateralAsset, deleverInfo.notionalSendQuantity);

uint256 postTradeReceiveQuantity = _executeTrade(deleverInfo, _collateralAsset, _repayAsset, _tradeData);

uint256 protocolFee = _accrueProtocolFee(_setToken, _repayAsset, postTradeReceiveQuantity);

uint256 repayQuantity = postTradeReceiveQuantity.sub(protocolFee);

_repayBorrow(deleverInfo.setToken, deleverInfo.lendingPool, _repayAsset, repayQuantity);

_updateDeleverPositions(deleverInfo, _repayAsset);
```

if the collateral token price falls and the collateral is liquidated (liquidator buying collateral asset in a discount)

withdraw asset from lending pool can revert if the collateral is liquidated or partially liquidated

it is possible the withdrawal when deleveraging push the protocol directly to liquidation

this not only make deleverage revert, but also force 

the position out of sycn because the function is below is never called

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Updates positions as per _updateLeverPositions and updates Default position for borrow asset in case Set is
     * delevered all the way to zero any remaining borrow asset after the debt is paid can be added as a position.
     */
    function _updateDeleverPositions(ActionInfo memory _actionInfo, IERC20 _repayAsset) internal {
        // if amount of tokens traded for exceeds debt, update default position first to save gas on editing borrow position
        uint256 repayAssetBalance = _repayAsset.balanceOf(address(_actionInfo.setToken));
        if (repayAssetBalance != _actionInfo.preTradeReceiveTokenBalance) {
            _actionInfo.setToken.calculateAndEditDefaultPosition(
                address(_repayAsset),
                _actionInfo.setTotalSupply,
                _actionInfo.preTradeReceiveTokenBalance
            );
        }

        _updateLeverPositions(_actionInfo, _repayAsset);
    }
```

## Impact

deleverage revert when withdrawal (bigger impact) and leverage revert when borrow (lower impact)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol check the collateral ratio (health factor) when withdraw asset before repay the debt

```solidity
_withdraw(deleverInfo.setToken, deleverInfo.lendingPool, _collateralAsset, deleverInfo.notionalSendQuantity);

// check health factor here before proceed

uint256 postTradeReceiveQuantity = _executeTrade(deleverInfo, _collateralAsset, _repayAsset, _tradeData);

uint256 protocolFee = _accrueProtocolFee(_setToken, _repayAsset, postTradeReceiveQuantity);

uint256 repayQuantity = postTradeReceiveQuantity.sub(protocolFee);

_repayBorrow(deleverInfo.setToken, deleverInfo.lendingPool, _repayAsset, repayQuantity);

_updateDeleverPositions(deleverInfo, _repayAsset);
```
