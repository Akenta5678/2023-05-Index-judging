# Chainlink's reported answer can be being carried over and stale

## Summary
There is  no check for round completeness
## Vulnerability Detail
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values mentions: "You can check answeredInRound against the current roundId. If answeredInRound is less than roundId, the answer is being carried over. If answeredInRound is equal to roundId, then the answer is fresh." However, the latestAnswer function, which is shown in the Code Snippet section, does not check answeredInRound against the current roundId, where answeredInRound and roundId are returned . This can lead to unreliable reported price based on the Chainlink's reported answer that is being carried over and stale.
```solidity
function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
        ActionInfo memory rebalanceInfo;

        // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
        // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals. 
        // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)
        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
```

## Impact
When the Chainlink's reported answer is being carried over and stale, such answer is not reliable. Using the reported price based on such unreliable answer can cause critical user actions, that should be disallowed to be allowed, or vice versa.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the below check for returned data

```solidity

 (uint80 roundID, int256 answer, uint256 timestamp, uint256 updatedAt, ) = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(answer > 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");

        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);
```
