# The protocol doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Not checking if the sequencer is down may result in bd actors obtaining inconsistent and unfair prices.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `engage()` function is responsible for initializing and managing the leverage position of a SetToken on a specific exchange.  Inside the function ,it retrieves the latest price of the asset from the Chainlink oracle. However, it does not check whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active.
The protocol intends to deploy to arbtrium as well!
Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds
If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.
```solidity
 function _createActionInfo() internal view returns(ActionInfo memory) {
        ActionInfo memory rebalanceInfo;

        // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
        // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals. 
        // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)
        int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
        rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
        int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
```

## Impact
Could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
