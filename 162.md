# StreamingFeeModule is notifying offchain even when there was no fee applicable.

## Summary
StreamingFeeModule accrues streaming fees for Set managers and tracks fees applicable to protocol and manager.
The fee is accrues based on the lastStreamingFeeTimestamp. So, tracking the lastStreamingFeeTimestamp is valid, but
when there is no accural of fee, then emiting an event is invalid.

The streamingFeeModule's accrueFee function emits FeeActualized event even when there was no fee appliable.
This offchain notification can be misleading and redundant.

## Vulnerability Detail
StreamingFeeModule accrues streaming fees for Set managers and tracks the break up of fee between manager and protocol.
the applicable fees are notified to offchain via FeeActualized event.  In the cases where there is no applicable fee also, the event is being emitted.

## Impact
The impact is minimal as the fee notified are 0 for both Manager and protocol. But, it is better to not fire event where there is no effective change in state on the change.
 
## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/StreamingFeeModule.sol#L86-L108

```solidity
  if (_streamingFeePercentage(_setToken) > 0) {
            uint256 inflationFeePercentage = _calculateStreamingFee(_setToken);

            // Calculate incentiveFee inflation
            uint256 feeQuantity = _calculateStreamingFeeInflation(_setToken, inflationFeePercentage);

            // Mint new Sets to manager and protocol
            (
                managerFee,
                protocolFee
            ) = _mintManagerAndProtocolFee(_setToken, feeQuantity);

            _editPositionMultiplier(_setToken, inflationFeePercentage);
        }

        feeStates[_setToken].lastStreamingFeeTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        emit FeeActualized(address(_setToken), managerFee, protocolFee);
```

The below emit event should be inside the if condition where streamFeePercentage is greater than 0.

**emit FeeActualized(address(_setToken), managerFee, protocolFee);**

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move the below emit inside the if condition.
emit FeeActualized(address(_setToken), managerFee, protocolFee)
