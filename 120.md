# Functions invoke deposit ,  invoke borrow and invoke repay use address (_set token) instead of (_OnBehalfOf).

## Summary

The address (es) calling the functions invoke deposit , invoke borrow and invoke repay are always subject to each of the actions of these function even if  other address (es)  are specified (_onbehalfof_) .

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Function invoke deposit.
To get relevant deposit data this function calls _getdepositcalldata_ function . Onbehalfof parameter in the function getdepositcalldata is defined as the address that will receive the aTokens, same as msg.sender if the user  wants to receive them on his own wallet, or a different address if the beneficiary of aTokens is a different wallet. However, the address parameter in function invoke deposit is set always to be msg.sender (address of set token)  and not ( _Onbehalfof ) meaning the receiver of atokens will always be the set token even if the user specified another address.
 ( , , bytes memory depositCalldata) = getDepositCalldata(
            _lendingPool,
            _asset,
            _amountNotional, 
            address(_setToken), 
            0
2. Function invoke borrow.
to get relevant borrow data this function calls _getborrowcalldata_ function which defines _Onbehalfof_ parameter as the Address of the user who will receive the debt. Should be the address of the borrower itself calling the function if he wants to borrow against his own collateral, or the address of the credit delegator if he has been given credit delegation allowance. The address parameter in the function invoke borrow however  is  set always to the address of the borrower itself ( address of the set token ) and not ( on behalf ) address meaning the address of the set token will always receive debt even if the user specified another address.
 bytes memory borrowCalldata) = getBorrowCalldata(
            _lendingPool,
            _asset,
            _amountNotional,
            _interestRateMode,
            0, 
            address(_setToken)
        );
3. Function invoke repay 
To get repay data this function calls _getrepaycalldata_ function which defines _Onbehalfof_ parameter as the  Address of the user who will get his debt reduced/removed. Should be the address of the user calling the function if he wants to reduce/remove his own debt, or the address of any other borrower whose debt should be removed. In contrast , the address specified in the function invoke repay is to be always the msg.sender and not (_onbehalfof ) meaning the debt of the address (set token ) will always be reduced even though debt of another address was supposed to be reduced.

        ( , , bytes memory repayCalldata) = getRepayCalldata(
            _lendingPool,
            _asset,
            _amountNotional,
            _interestRateMode,
            address(_setToken)
        );
# Impact

the addresses of the set token calling functions invoke deposit , invoke borrow and invoke repay will always be on the receiving end of each of their actions even if other address (es)  (_onbehalfof ) is specified.

## Recommendation
In each of the functions invoke deposit , invoke borrow and invoke repay replace the address parameter (_set token ) with (_Onbehalfof ).
