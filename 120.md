# Functions invoke deposit sends atokens to address (_set token) instead of (_OnBehalfOf).

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

To get relevant deposit data this function calls getdepositcalldata function . Onbehalfof parameter in the function getdepositcalldata is defined as the address that will receive the aTokens, same as msg.sender if the user wants to receive them on his own wallet, or a different address if the beneficiary of aTokens is a different wallet. However, the address parameter in function invoke deposit is set always to be msg.sender (address of set token) and not ( _Onbehalfof ) meaning the receiver of atokens will always be the set token even if the user specified another address.

        ( , , bytes memory depositCalldata) = getDepositCalldata(
            _lendingPool,
            _asset,
            _amountNotional, 
            address(_setToken), 
            0
        );
        

## Impact

atokens are sent to an unintended address.
