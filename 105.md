# In AaveV3leverageModule.sol's lever() function there's no check to ensure that _minReceiveQuantityUnits is directly proportional to _borrowQuantityUnits

## Summary
the minimum quantity of collateral asset( `_minReceiveQuantityUnits`) in position units received in lever() might not be directly proportional to the quantity of borrow asset( `_borrowQuantityUnits`) in position units when leveraging

## Vulnerability Detail
The lever() function in AaveV3LeverageModule.sol Performs a DEX trade, exchanging the _borrowAsset for _collateralAsset. It also increases leverage for a given collateral position.

since the lever() function exchanges the _borrowAsset for _collateralAsset. The quantity of _borrowAsset exchanged for _collateralAsset should be directly proportional.

The issue is that the lever() function doesn't ensure that.

1. i believe this is some sort of slippage.. like for example:
if _borrowAsset is ETH, `_borrowQuantityUnits` is the quantity of ETH used in leverage and _collateralAsset is USDT, `_minReceiveQuantityUnits` is the amount of USDT to receive from exchanging ETH for USDT.
As of the time of writing this report 1ETH = 1,883 USDT

it is possible that when using lever() the quantity of USDT i receive is smaller than what i'm supposed to receive.(i.e 1ETH = 1,883 USDT), this is possible due to network congestion which can hold the lever() tx in the mempool for a long time and the price of ETH/USDT changes unfavorably so i don't receive the amount of USDT / ETH i'm supposed to receive.

2. the manager might specify a lower quantity of collateral assets to receive for the exchange of borrow asset to collateral asset.
for example, lets say i'm the manager and borrow asset is ETH while collateral asset is USDT and the price is 1ETH/1,883USDT
now if manager wants to leverage since there's no check against this, manager can put 500 as `_minReceiveQuantityUnits` for 1 ETH(`_borrowQuantityUnits`), whilst it's supposed to be 1,883, this results in losing 1383 USDT


## Impact
1. slippage in quantity of borrow asset(`_borrowQuantityUnits`) per quantity of collateral asset(`_minReceiveQuantityUnits`)

2.` _minReceiveQuantityUnits` in position units of collateral asset specified by manager is not equivalent to `_borrowQuantityUnits` in position units, leading to manager getting less collateral asset quantity(`_minReceiveQuantityUnits`) that's less compared to what he's supposed to get from the exchange of borrow assets to collateral assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
there should be a check to ensure that `_minReceiveQuantityUnits` in position units received is directly proportional to `_borrowQuantityUnits` in position units used for leverage
