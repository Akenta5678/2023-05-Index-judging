# onlyEOA modifier that ensures call is from EOA might not hold true with the eip 3074


## Summary
modifier onlyEOAE is used to ensure calls are only made from EOA. However, EIP 3074 suggests that using onlyEOAE modifier to ensure calls are only from EOA might not hold true.
## Vulnerability Detail
For onlyEOAEx, tx.origin is used to ensure that the caller is from an EOA and not a smart contract.

```solidity
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        // here we could have serious issue with the upcoming EIP
        require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
        _;
    }
```

However, according to [EIP 3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074#abstract),

This EIP introduces two EVM instructions AUTH and AUTHCALL. The first sets a context variable authorized based on an ECDSA signature. The second sends a call as the authorized account. This essentially delegates control of the externally owned account (EOA) to a smart contract.

Therefore, using tx.origin to ensure msg.sender is an EOA will not hold true in the event EIP 3074 goes through.

As the EIP states itself:

****AUTH allows for signatures to be signed by tx.origin. For any such signatures, subsequent AUTHCALLs have msg.sender == tx.origin in their first layer of execution. Without EIP-3074, this situation can only ever arise in the topmost execution layer of a transaction. This EIP breaks that invariant and so affects smart contracts containing require(msg.sender == tx.origin) checks.

Allowing authorized to equal tx.origin has the possibility to:

    Break atomic sandwich protections which rely on tx.origin;
    Break re-entrancy guards of the style require(tx.origin == msg.sender).

The authors of this EIP believe the risks of allowing authorized to equal tx.origin are acceptable for the reasons outlined in the Rationale section.****


It gives a false sense of security from flash loan attacks which may not hold through if the eip goes through.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZepellin's isContract function (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/utils#Address-isContract-address-). Note that there are edge cases like contract in constructor that can bypass this and hence caution is required when using this.
```solidity
    modifier onlyEOAEx() {
        if (!allowContractCalls && !whitelistedContracts[msg.sender]) {
            if (isContract(msg.sender)) revert NOT_EOA(msg.sender);
        }
        _;
    }
```
