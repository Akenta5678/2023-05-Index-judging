# onlyEOA modifier that ensures call is from EOA might not hold true in the future

## Summary
modifier onlyEOA is used to ensure calls are only made from EOA. However, EIP 3074 suggests that using onlyEOA modifier to ensure calls are only from EOA might not hold true.

## Vulnerability Detail
For [onlyEOA](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/lib/BaseExtension.sol#L59) , tx.origin is used to ensure that the caller is from an EOA and not a smart contract.

```solidity
    /**
     * Throws if caller is a contract, can be used to stop flash loan and sandwich attacks
     */
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
        _;
    }
```

However, according to [EIP 3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074#abstract),

This EIP introduces two EVM instructions AUTH and AUTHCALL. The first sets a context variable authorized based on an ECDSA signature. The second sends a call as the authorized account. This essentially delegates control of the externally owned account (EOA) to a smart contract.

Therefore, using tx.origin to ensure msg.sender is an EOA will not hold true in the event EIP 3074 goes through.

## Impact
Using modifier onlyEOA to ensure calls are made only from EOA will not hold true in the event EIP 3074 goes through.
