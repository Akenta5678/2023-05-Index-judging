# onlyEOA() modifier could be bypassed in the future due to EIP3074

## Summary

The onlyEOA() modifier is used in the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension to ensure that calls are not made from smart contracts. With EIP 3074 this would not function as expected.

This issue has been reported in previous reports on Sherlock. See [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/21) as a reference.

## Vulnerability Detail
In AaveLeverageStrategyExtension the following modifier is used

```solidity
    /**
     * Throws if caller is a contract, can be used to stop flash loan and sandwich attacks
     */
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
        _;
    }
```

As the comments above explain, this is to protect from sandwich and flashloan attacks. 

This  modifier protects `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension#rebalance()`, `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension#uterateRebalance()` and `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension#ripcord`.

With [EIP3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074#abstract) the `tx.origin = msg.sender` check will not guarantee that the caller is an EOA since the control of an EOA can be delegated to a smart contract.

## Impact

`onlyEOA()` could be bypassed in the future which means that the protection against sandwich attacks and flashloan attacks is not functioning.

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's `isContract()` see their [documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074#abstract) for details.
