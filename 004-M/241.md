# Check that call is from EOA may not hold true in the future

## Summary

Within the `onlyEOA` modifier, the following code is used to check that the caller is an EOA:

```solidity
    require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Caller must be EOA Address");
```

However, [EIP3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074) would mean that this does not provide such a guarantee.

## Vulnerability Detail

[EIP3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074) introduces two EVM instructions `AUTH` and `AUTHCALL`. The first sets a context variable authorized based on an ECDSA signature. The second sends a call as the authorized account. This essentially delegates control of the externally owned account (EOA) to a smart contract.

Therefore, using tx.origin to ensure msg.sender is an EOA will not hold true in the event EIP 3074 goes through.

## Impact

Current checks to ensure caller is an EOA will be easily bypassable in the event that EIP3074 goes through.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the bytecode size of the calling address to determine whether the user is an EOA:

```solidity
    require(msg.sender.code.length == 0, "Caller must be EOA Address");
```

Note that this check will still be passed by
- a contract in construction
- an address where a contract will be created
- an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed

hence caution is still required.
