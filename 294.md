# Wrong modifier in `transferTokens()`

## Summary
In `BaseManagerV2.sol` we have `transferTokens()`:
```solidity
/**
     * OPERATOR ONLY: Transfers _tokens held by the manager to _destination. Can be used to
     * recover anything sent here accidentally. In BaseManagerV2, extensions should
     * be the only contracts designated as `feeRecipient` in fee modules.
     *
     * @param _token           ERC20 token to send
     * @param _destination     Address receiving the tokens
     * @param _amount          Quantity of tokens to send
     */

    function transferTokens(address _token, address _destination, uint256 _amount) external onlyExtension { 
        IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_destination, _amount);
    }
```
This function transfers any ERC20 tokens held by the manager to a specified destination address.

## Vulnerability Detail

As we can see from `Natspec` and from the function itself it uses the wrong modifier.
The function uses `onlyExtension` but needs to use `onlyOperator` modifier.

It is very important to add proper access control to `transferTokens()`.

## Impact

Wrong access control

## Recommendation

Remove `onlyExtension` and add `onlyOperator` modifier to `transferTokens()` function.
