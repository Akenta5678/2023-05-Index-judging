# Possible instant liquidations in some sitautions

## Summary

If a settoken manager enables emode, borrows with a ltv higher than normal and then disables it, it could result in instant liquidations/ripcords

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose that a settoken manager enables emode on DAI. Instead of having a max ltv of 75%, the manager now has an ltv of 97%. Then he disables emode. This can result in instant liquidations


## Impact

A position could be instantly liquidated 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If emode in enabled for an asset, check the ltv for the non emode enabled asset before disabling it.
