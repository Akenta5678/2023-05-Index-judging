# Methodology settings can be changed by operator instead of methodologist

## Summary

The AaveV3LeverageModule contract allows the operator to change the methodology settings that define the token strategy. However, according to the role description, this should be done by the methodologist.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the role description in audit channel, operator and methodologist roles are defined as:

        - Operator:
        The party that is responsible for "day to day management" of the set token. Often this means ensuring that the set token is regularily rebalanced to adhere to a certain strategy.

        - Methodologist:
        Sets and controls the parameter that define a set tokens strategy and put guardrails on the actions of the Operator.
        While those two roles could be held by the same party, for some of our products we will have an external partner act as Methodologist.

However, in the AaveV3LeverageModule contract, the function to set methodology `setMethodologySettings` can only be called by the operator instead of the methodologist.

        function setMethodologySettings(MethodologySettings memory _newMethodologySettings) external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
            methodology = _newMethodologySettings;

            _validateNonExchangeSettings(methodology, execution, incentive);

            emit MethodologySettingsUpdated(
                methodology.targetLeverageRatio,
                methodology.minLeverageRatio,
                methodology.maxLeverageRatio,
                methodology.recenteringSpeed,
                methodology.rebalanceInterval
            );
        }

This means that the operator can change the parameters that define the token strategy without any input or restriction from the methodologist.

## Impact

The operator has more authority than defined in the role and does not have any guardrails from the methodologist.

## Recommendation

Change the modifier from `onlyOperator` to `onlyMethodologist` in the `setMethodologySettings` function.

```diff
-        function setMethodologySettings(MethodologySettings memory _newMethodologySettings) external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
+        function setMethodologySettings(MethodologySettings memory _newMethodologySettings) external onlyMethodologist noRebalanceInProgress {
```
