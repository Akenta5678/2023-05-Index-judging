# Using transfer may cause function revert

## Summary

The _transferEtherRewardToCaller function uses msg.sender.transfer to transfer ETH to the caller. However, this may cause the function to revert in the future due to gas cost changes.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_transferEtherRewardToCaller` function in the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract transfers ETH to the caller as a reward for rebalancing.

        function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) internal returns(uint256) {
            uint256 etherToTransfer = _etherReward < address(this).balance ? _etherReward : address(this).balance;

            msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer); 

            return etherToTransfer;
        }

However, the transfer function should be avoided because it only forwards 2300 gas and gas costs can and will change in the future. If gas costs are subject to change, then smart contracts canâ€™t depend on any fixed gas costs.

## Impact

The `transfer` function may revert and prevent the reward from being transferred.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Stop using transfer and switch to using call instead. For example:

```diff
- msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer);
+ (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: etherToTransfer}("");
+ require(success, "Transfer failed");
```
