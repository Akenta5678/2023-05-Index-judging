# AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension is at Risk of DOS if Chainlink Access is Blocked

## Summary

The AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension's functionality could become severely limited if access to the Chainlink oracle data feed is blocked. A denial of service (DOS) could occur, impacting the creation of the ActionInfo struct utilized in internal functions.

NB: This function is extensively used within the AaveLeverageStrategyExtension contract, in functions like `engage()`, `getCurrentLeverageRatio()`, `getChunkRebalanceNotional()`, and internal `_getAndValidateLeveragedInfo()` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension uses the Chainlink oracle data feed to get prices in the `_createActionInfo` function. This function is used to create an ActionInfo struct that stores vital data used by internal lever/delever and other functions.

The vulnerability lies in these lines:

```solidity
int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);

int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice = rawBorrowPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.borrowDecimalAdjustment);
```

As https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles/ mentions, it is possible that Chainlink’s “multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will”. When this occurs, the execution of either `strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer()` or `strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer()` will revert.

As a result, the creation of the ActionInfo struct fails, leading to a cascade of issues in other functions that depend on the ActionInfo struct, and ultimately, causing a DOS.

### Proof of Concept

Consider a scenario:

1. Chainlink oracle data feed is used for getting prices.
2. Any of the function that calls `_createActionInfo` is executed to get an ActionInfo struct.
3. Suddenly, Chainlink's multisigs block access to price feeds. Executing `strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer()` or `strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer()` now reverts.
4. The creation of the ActionInfo struct fails, which eventually causes the parent function to fail.
5. If other functions that depend on `_createActionInfo` are called, they will also fail, leading to a potential DOS.

## Impact

Should Chainlink's multisigs block access to price feeds, the AaveV3LeverageStrategyExtension's functionality becomes very limited due to the failed creation of the ActionInfo struct. This effectively results in a denial of service (DOS) attack.

## Tool used

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

Refactor `_createActionInfo` to include a try-catch block for the price feed calls. Consider providing a fallback logic when the access to the Chainlink oracle data feed is denied.

Here is a base to build a refactored version on using try-catch:

```solidity
try {
    int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
    rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
} catch Error(string memory) {
    // Implement fallback logic here
}

try {
    int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
    rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice = rawBorrowPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.borrowDecimalAdjustment);
} catch Error(string memory) {
    // Implement fallback logic here
}
```

The fallback logic could be obtaining the token's price from another reliable oracle or any other predetermined strategy that ensures continuity in the absence of Chainlink price feeds.
