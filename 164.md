# DoS - No Issuance / Borrowing possible because of AAVEv3 Isolation mode.

## Summary

An attacker or malicous user can force the AAVE position of the setToken to AAVEv3 Isolation mode. This will prevent the contract from enabling other Assets as Collateral, and borrowing of some tokens and therefore finally issuance of new Tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

AAVEv3 introduced Isolation mode, which `allows to list new assets as Isolated which has a specific debt ceiling and can be only used to borrow stablecoins that have been permitted, by Aave Governance, to be borrowable in isolation mode.`
Therefore when the position is in Isolation mode and the in AAVEv3LeverageModule defined Collateral/Borrow Assets do not match the criteria they cannot be used as Collateral/borrowed. 

An Attacker can force the position into Isolation Mode by supplying an (small) amount of an isolated Asset on behalf of the target `SetToken`, when it is holding no other aTokens (yet). (AAVev3´s supply funcion allows supplying for other recpients). This will result in the `SetToken` contract to receive the corresponding aToken. If this is the first aToken for the Address (SetToken Contract) AAVe will automatically enable it as collateral, and in case it is an isolated asset enable Isolation mode. (see [AAve DOcs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/whats-new/isolation-mode))

As the DebtIssuanceModulev2 is used to issue Tokens and the registered component Hooks inside the `ÀAveV3LeverageModule`invoke a borrow call on AAve (which probably fails) it is not anymore possible to issue any Tokens.

## Impact

- No new SetTokens can be issued
- SetToken cannot borrow more Tokens on AAVE

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if there are other aTokens, than the enabled Collateral Tokens in the Contract, and if yes, mark them as not to be used as collateral
