# Transaction revert if the Token does not support 0 value transfer

## Summary
Transaction revert if the Token does not support 0 value transfer

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact
In transferTokens(), Transaction revert if the Token does not support 0 value transfer when transferring tokens to destination address.

In BaseManagerV2.sol, transferTokens() function is given by,

```solidity
File: contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol

318    function transferTokens(address _token, address _destination, uint256 _amount) external onlyExtension {
319       IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_destination, _amount);
320    }
```
The transferTokens() function provides the ability for the owner to recover ANY tokens accidentally sent to this contract. This token can be any token which will be accidentally sent to contract address like it can be LEND token. Let's consider the LEND token is accidentally transferred to the contract. The issue is at L-319, if the amount is 0, the code would revert if the ERC20 token does not support 0 value transfer.

According to https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers

Some tokens (e.g. LEND) revert when transferring a zero value amount.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend to check if the amount is 0 before performing transfer in transferTokens() function.

```solidity
File: contracts/manager/BaseManagerV2.sol

    function transferTokens(address _token, address _destination, uint256 _amount) external onlyExtension {
+    if (_amount != 0 ) {
      IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_destination, _amount);
+    }
    }
```
