# ``` withdrawEtherBalance``` and ```_transferEtherRewardToCaller``` functions lacks payable on msg.sender, causing potential compilation errors when transferring Ether.

## Summary
The ```withdrawEtherBalance``` function in the provided code snippet has a vulnerability where msg.sender is not wrapped with payable, potentially leading to compilation errors when transferring Ether.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Solidity compiler enforces strict type-checking and requires an explicit indication of addresses that can receive Ether. By omitting payable when attempting to transfer Ether to msg.sender, the compiler would raise an error similar to: "TypeError: Member 'transfer' not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in the address".

## Impact
The vulnerability results in a compilation error, preventing the successful deployment of the contract. Consequently, there would be no way to withdraw the funds from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, it is recommended to wrap msg.sender with payable in the `withdrawEtherBalance` function. This ensures the address can receive Ether and avoids compilation errors during the transfer process.
