# Users still can call rebalance/iterateRebalance after disengage is called

## Summary
Users still can call rebalance/iterateRebalance after disengage that doesn't repaid full debt is called, because it doesn't clear state.
## Vulnerability Detail
When operator calls `disengage` that means that he wants to shut down strategy an fully repay debt.
It's possible that he will not be able to do that [through the one step](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L426-L430). In this case it will be needed to call `disengage` several times.

`disengage` function doesn't make any state changes to the contract. Because of that users are still able to call `rebalance`/`iterateRebalance` function. In case if this rebalancing will be done in lever side, this will not help operator to delever positions.

Example.
1.`twapLeverageRatio` is not 0, so `iterateRebalance` can be called.
2.operator calls `disengage`, and does partial delever.
3.any user calls `iterateRebalance` and make lever again.
4.as result user can make problems for operator to make full deleverage.
## Impact
Users still allowed to lever position

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe there is a need to add some global state variable that pauses users ability to call functions, when `disengage` is called.
