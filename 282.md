# It's possible to withdraw the contract balance during rebalance period

## Summary
In `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol` we have `withdrawEtherBalance()` function:
```solidity
/**
     * OPERATOR ONLY: Withdraw entire balance of ETH in this contract to operator. Rebalance must not be in progress
     */
    function withdrawEtherBalance() external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
```
 This function withdraws the entire balance of ETH in this contract to the operator. 
 - *Rebalance must not be in progress*
 
## Vulnerability Detail

But there is a way to pull the balance out of the contract and get around `noRebalanceInProgress()`.

- A user can call the `ripcord()` function to get rewards in ETH
- `ripcord()` call `_transferEtherRewardToCaller()` function
- If the ETH balance on this contract is less than the required incentive quantity, then transfer the contract balance instead to prevent reverts

In this situation, ETH can be withdrawn from the contract during the rebalancing period.

## Impact

`noRebalanceInProgress()` modifier can be bypassed and ETH balance can be withdrawn during the rebalance period

## Recommendation

Add `noRebalanceInProgress()` modifier to `_transferEtherRewardToCaller()`
