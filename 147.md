# Components delta updates with a higher value  than the actual received components in functions addliquiditysingleasset and removeliquiditysingleasset.

## Summary

  When performing liquidity adjustments for single assets ( adding or removing liquidity ), the last step is updating  the components delta with the value of components received. This value is determined by calling  _updatecomponentsposition_  function, which sets  the components received  to the value obtained by subtracting the _preactioncomponentsbalance_ from the current component balances. However, an issue arises when utilizing the _getactioninfosingleasset_  function during the addition or removal of liquidity for a single asset, as it does not provide the necessary pre-action component  balance. Therefore, the components received will equate to the current components balance (i.e., the total balance after adding or removing liquidity for the single asset). As a result, the components delta ends up being updated with more components than which were actually received.

## Vulnerability Detail

 function _updateComponentPositions(ActionInfo memory _actionInfo) internal returns(int256[] memory) {
        int256[] memory componentsReceived = new int256[](_actionInfo.components.length);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _actionInfo.components.length; i++) {

            (uint256 currentComponentBalance,,) = _actionInfo.setToken.calculateAndEditDefaultPosition(
                _actionInfo.components[i],
                _actionInfo.totalSupply,
                _actionInfo.preActionComponentBalances[i]
            );

            componentsReceived[i] = currentComponentBalance.toInt256()
                                        .sub(_actionInfo.preActionComponentBalances[i].toInt256());
        }

        return componentsReceived;
    }
As shown this function returns the components received which is obtained by subtracting the _preactioncomponentbalance_ from the current component balance. however the _getactioninfosingleasset_  function does not determine the _preactioncomponentsbalance_  hence this function will return the current component balance and not the components received ( when adding or removing liquidity for a single asset ).

Note : this function works correctly with functions _addliquidity_ and _removeliquidity_  but not with _addliquiditysingleasset_ and _removeliquiditysingleasset_.

## Impact

Components delta will be updated with a higher value than the actual received components in  functions _addliquiditysingleasset_  and  _removeliquiditysingleasset_ .
