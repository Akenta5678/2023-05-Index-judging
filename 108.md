# missing slippage protection on AaveV3leverageModule.sol's lever() function

## Summary
There should be slippage protection in functions that exchange one asset for another. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The lever() function in AaveV3LeverageModule.sol Performs a DEX trade, exchanging the _borrowAsset for _collateralAsset
It also increases leverage position for a given collateral position

Now the lever() function doesn't have slippage protection which means that the trade can potentially be executed without considering the acceptable deviation in the trade price. As a result, the actual trade execution might deviate significantly from the expected trade price, which could have adverse effects on the outcome of the leverage operation.

Without slippage protection, the trade could experience high price slippage. This could result in receiving a smaller amount of the collateral asset in return for the borrowed asset.

`_borrowQuantityUnits`: is the Amount of debtToken to borrow(i.e _borrowAsset) and then sell on dex
`_minReceiveQuantityUnits`: Is the minimum amount of collateralToken that we receive for selling the debt token

there should be a check to ensure that only a certain percentage in price slippage is allowed during the leverage operation.

in a situation like Network Congestion which happens regularly in Mainnet this can happen as the transaction will be delayed for a period of time.

## Impact
the minimum amount of collateralToken that we receive for selling the debt token can be much smaller compared to the amount of debtToken we borrowed and then sold on dex due to price slippage.
