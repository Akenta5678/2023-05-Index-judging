# In AaveV3leverageModule.sol's delever() function there's no check to ensure that `_minRepayQuantityUnits` is directly proportional to `_redeemQuantityUnits`

## Summary
the minimum quantity of repay asset(`_minRepayQuantityUnits`) in position units received in delever() might not be directly proportional to the quantity of collateral asset(`_redeemQuantityUnits`) in position units when deleveraging.

## Vulnerability Detail
The delever() function in AaveV3LeverageModule.sol Performs a DEX trade, exchanging the _collateralAsset for _repayAsset. It also decrease leverage for a given collateral position.

since the delever() function exchanges the _collateralAsset for _repayAsset. The quantity of _collateralAsset exchanged for _repayAsset should be directly proportional.

The issue is that the delever() function doesn't ensure that.

1. i believe this is some sort of slippage.. like for example:

if _collateralAsset is ETH, `_redeemQuantityUnits` is the quantity of ETH used in deleverage  and _repayAsset is USDT, `_minRepayQuantityUnits` is the amount of USDT to receive from exchanging ETH for USDT. 
As of the time of writing this report 1ETH = 1,883 USDT

it is possible that when using delever() the quantity of USDT i receive is smaller than what i'm supposed to receive.(i.e 1ETH = 1,883 USDT), this is possible due to network congestion which can hold the delever() tx in the mempool for a long time and the price of ETH/USDT changes unfavorably so i don't receive the amount of USDT / ETH i'm supposed to receive.


2. the manager might specify a lower quantity of repay assets to receive for the exchange of collateral asset to repay asset.
for example, lets say i'm the manager and collateral asset is ETH while repay asset is USDT and the price is 1ETH/1,883USDT

now if manager want to delever since there's no check against this manager can put 500 as `_minRepayQuantityUnits` for 1 ETH (`_redeemQuantityUnits`), whilst it's supposed to be 1,883, this results in losing 1383 USDT

## Impact
1. slippage in quantity of Collateral asset(`_redeemQuantityUnits`) per quantity of Repay asset(`_minRepayQuantityUnits`)

2. `_minRepayQuantityUnits` in position units of repay asset specified by manager is not equivalent to `_redeemQuantityUnits` in position units, leading to manager getting less repay asset quantity(`_minRepayQuantityUnits`) that's less compared to what he's supposed to get from the exchange of collateral assets to repay assets.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
there should be a check to ensure that `_minRepayQuantityUnits` in position units received is directly proportional to _redeemQuantityUnits in position units when deleveraging
