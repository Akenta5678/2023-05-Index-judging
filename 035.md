# in ExplicitERC20.sol, the transferFrom function doesn't ensure that the `from` balance >= `_quantity`

## Summary
the `from` balance should be = `_quantity` or > `_quantity`
## Vulnerability Detail
the `transferFrom` should have a sanity check to ensure that `from` must have a balance of at least `_quantity`.

checking OpenZeppelin's implementation of their `transferFrom()` function it is part of their requirements.
