# Use of deprecated Chainlink function - latestAnswer()

## Summary

Use of deprecated Chainlink function - latestAnswer()

## Vulnerability Detail

`AaveLeverageStrategyExtension` using Chainlink priceFeeds to get the latest prices of collateral and borrow assets:

```solidity
File: AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol
892:         // Calculate prices from chainlink. Chainlink returns prices with 8 decimal places, but we need 36 - underlyingDecimals decimal places.
893:         // This is so that when the underlying amount is multiplied by the received price, the collateral valuation is normalized to 36 decimals. 
894:         // To perform this adjustment, we multiply by 10^(36 - 8 - underlyingDecimals)
895:         int256 rawCollateralPrice = strategy.collateralPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
896:         rebalanceInfo.collateralPrice = rawCollateralPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.collateralDecimalAdjustment);
897:         int256 rawBorrowPrice = strategy.borrowPriceOracle.latestAnswer();
898:         rebalanceInfo.borrowPrice = rawBorrowPrice.toUint256().mul(10 ** strategy.borrowDecimalAdjustment);
```

However, due to Chainlink documentation `latestAnwer()` function is deprecated, and the doc explicitly states that it should not be used:
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer

Whore mentions that the value returned from oracle was not checked and could be stale, which could happen if oracle doesn't update it for some period of time. Also comments in contract states that Chainlink feed would return 8 decimals value, which not always correct, for example, DAI/ETH priceFeed returns 18 decimals:

## Impact

Protocol use deprecated Chainlink `latestAnswer()` function, this could result in incorrect calculation or DOS of some functions, for example, `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension#engage`.

## Recommendation

Consider using Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` function and adding a sanity check for return price, round, and timestamp.
