# `withdrawEtherBalance()` will fail for MultiSig operator

## Summary
The operator is expected to be a MultiSig. The integration sends ETH to that address with a gas stipend of 2300 which won't be enough for the call to succeed.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.withdrawEtherBalance()` the contract's ETH is sent to the operator address using the `transfer()` function:

```sol
    /**
     * OPERATOR ONLY: Withdraw entire balance of ETH in this contract to operator. Rebalance must not be in progress
     */
    function withdrawEtherBalance() external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
```

But, the operator address is expected to be a MultiSig: 0x6904110f17feD2162a11B5FA66B188d801443Ea4

At least, that's the case for the other modules, e.g.
- https://etherscan.io/address/0xb97f5a34696adf30db822612379235c3c53b714a#readContract#F10
- https://etherscan.io/address/0x0749ce17c983deb806d6b841c65b7359c3d5b104#readContract#F10

GnosisSafe proxies don't implement `receive()` but use `fallback()` which will use more than 2300 gas:

```sol
    fallback() external payable {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
        assembly {
            let _singleton := and(sload(0), 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)
            // 0xa619486e == keccak("masterCopy()"). The value is right padded to 32-bytes with 0s
            if eq(calldataload(0), 0xa619486e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) {
                mstore(0, _singleton)
                return(0, 0x20)
            }
            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
            let success := delegatecall(gas(), _singleton, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
            returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
            if eq(success, 0) {
                revert(0, returndatasize())
            }
            return(0, returndatasize())
        }
    }
```

That will cause the transfer to fail.

## Impact
The module won't be able to use an operator that's a MultiSig. That will heavily reduce the security of the module since key functionality and configuration is handled by that address. It being a simple 1:1 hot wallet increases the risk of the module being compromised.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `call()` instead of `transfer()`. Since the address is trusted, there's no risk of reentrancy.
