# Loss of user funds  - unchecked Return of ERC20 Transfer

## Summary

Silently failing transfers can result in a partial or total loss of the users investment.

## Vulnerability Detail


Some ERC20 Tokens do not revert on failure of the transfer function, but return a bool value instead. Some do not return any value. Therefore it is required to check if a value was returned, and if true, which value it is. This is not done on some places in these contracts.

The `DebtIssuanceModulev2`, which is required to issue or redeem tokens whenever there is a LeverageModule involved uses the `invokeTransfer` function of the `Invoke` library to transfer ERC20 Tokens from the `SetToken` to the user.

`invokeTransfer` is encoding the Calldata for the regular `transfer` function of ERC20 tokens and  passes it together with the target (ERC20 token address) the SetTokens generic `invoke` function, whichin turn uses `functionCallWithValue` from the Openzeppelin Address Library. This method is bubbling up a possible revert of the call and returning the raw data.

The generic `invoke` is returning this raw data, however in `invokeTransfer` the return value of `invoke` is ignored and not used. 
As some ERC20 Tokens do not revert on a failed transfer, but instead return a `false` bool value, the stated behaviour can lead to silently failing transfers.

This is inside the `DebtIssuanceModulev2` used to:

1. Transfer The "debt" (borrowed) Tokens to the user at Issuance
2. Transfer back the main component Tokens (e.g. aTokens) to the user at Redemption

If such a Transfer silently fails, the funds will remain inside the setToken contract and the user has no chance to recover them.

In the issuance event the user receives the SetTokens but not the borrowed Tokens, which he has to repay when he wants to redeem the tokens. (Results in Loss of the "Debt")

In the redemption event the user repays his debt & bruns his Set Tokens, but never receives his original Tokens back. (Total Loss of investment)

## Impact

Possible Loss of all/part of the Investment for the User

## Code Snippet

Usage of invokeTransfer in`DebtIssuanceModulev2`:

`invokeTransfer` function ignores return value of `invoke`:

`invoke` uses `functionCallwithValue` and returns the raw return Data (which is ignored in this case):

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check for the existence and value of the returned data of the Transfer call. If there is a return value, it has to be true. This could be achieved by using Openzeppelins SafeERC20 libraryÂ´s `safeTransfer`.
