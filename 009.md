# rebalance would get stuck in the middle of a rebalance if wstETH market reaches supply cap

## Summary
rebalance would get stuck in the middle of a rebalance if wstETH market reaches supply cap

## Vulnerability Detail
1. rebalance implement a cap of tradeSize and if the need to rebalance require taking more assets than the maxTradeSize, then `twapLeverageRatio` would be set to the targeted leverage.
2. twapLeverageRatio == 0 is required during `rebalance`.

Consider:
1. lever is needed during rebalance, the strategy require to borrow more ETH and sell to wstETH
2. during the 1st call of rebalance the protocol cache the new twapLeverageRatio
3. However wstETH market in Aave reach supply cap. rebalance/iterateRebalance comes to a halt.
4. Some times later the price of wstETH drops, the protocol needs to call rebalance to delever.
5. However the supply cap in wstETH is still at cap, twapLeverageRatio can not be set to 0 and the protocol fails to rebalance.

```solidity

     function rebalance(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA onlyAllowedCaller(msg.sender) {
        LeverageInfo memory leverageInfo = _getAndValidateLeveragedInfo(
            execution.slippageTolerance,
            exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].twapMaxTradeSize,
            _exchangeName
        );

        // use globalLastTradeTimestamps to prevent multiple rebalances being called with different exchanges during the epoch rebalance
        _validateNormalRebalance(leverageInfo, methodology.rebalanceInterval, globalLastTradeTimestamp);
        _validateNonTWAP();


...

    function _validateNonTWAP() internal view {
        require(twapLeverageRatio == 0, "Must call iterate");
    }

```

## Impact
the protocol fails to rebalance in the above scenario.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add some checks on whether the supply cap of an Aave market is reached during a rebalance. If so, allows a re-set of twapLeverageRatio
