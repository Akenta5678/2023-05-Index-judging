# Use safeTransferFrom() Instead of transferFrom() For ERC20 Transfers

## Summary

The transferFrom() function uses the transferFrom() method instead of safeTransferFrom().

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens that are not compliant with the specification could return false from the transferFrom function call to indicate that the transfer fails, but the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked. The EIP-20 specification requires checking the return value.

## Impact

Callers might not properly handle tokens that are not ERC20 compliant.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend using the safeTransferFrom() method by OpenZeppelin instead of transferFrom().
