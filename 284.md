# AaveLeverageStrategyExtension and underlying AaveV3 oracles may diverge

## Summary

Both AaveLeverageStrategyExtension and the underlying AaveV3 protocol utilize oracles. AaveLeverageStrategyExtension uses an (effectively) immutable oracle while AaveV3 uses it's in-house AaveOracle. While both are initially use Chainlink, the AaveV3 oracle is mutable and can be changed at a later time. This allows divergence between the two oracles and therefore a difference in decision making based on those differences. Since AaveV3 is the underlying protocol that enforces liquidation it is extremely important that the extension uses the same oracle at all times.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary.

## Impact

Divergence in oracle data may lead to a host of issues including liquidation, especially due to the leverage nature of the contracts

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Utilize AaveOracle rather than setting a different one
