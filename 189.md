# XO-Missing Library Import and Incorrect Function Usage in removeSet Function

## Summary
- The `removeSet` function can cause a runtime error if the address is not in the sets mapping. This can lead to data loss or other problems.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/**
     * PRIVILEGED GOVERNANCE FUNCTION. Allows governance to remove a Set
     *
     * @param _setToken               Address of the SetToken contract to remove
     */
    function removeSet(address _setToken) external onlyInitialized onlyOwner {
        require(isSet[_setToken], "Set does not exist");

        sets = sets.remove(_setToken);

        isSet[_setToken] = false;

        emit SetRemoved(_setToken);
    }
```
- there is a vulnerability in the `removeSet` function, the problem is in the line `sets = sets.remove(_setToken);`, this line  is tries to remove the `_setToken` from the `sets` mapping, if the `_setToken` is not in the `sets` mapping, then this will cause a runtime error.
## Impact
- if an attacker exploit this it's can cause a runtime error, which can lead to data loss or other problems.
