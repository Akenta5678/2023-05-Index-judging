# Use of deprecated chainlink function - `latestAnswer()`

## Summary
According to Chainlink's documentation - [API Reference](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#getanswer), the `latestAnswer()` function is deprecated. This function doesnot throw any error if no answer has been reached, but instead returns 0. Possibly causing an incorrect price feed or even a Denial of Service by a division by zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
Use of deprecate function 'lastestAnswer()` for chainlink oracle could lead completely incorrect price feed or denial of service attack. 

## Impact
1. Incorrect price feed resulting loss of funds. 
2. Highly probable Denial of Service

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to use Chainlinkâ€™s [`latestRoundData()`](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata) function to get
the price instead. It is also recommended to add checks on the return
data with proper revert messages if the price is stale or the round is
incomplete.
