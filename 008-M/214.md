# SetToken could be locked if they enable USDT as borrowed asset on Ethereum network

## Summary
Note the following
* [USDT on ethereum](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code) requires that allowance is 0 when setting a new value that's not 0.
* All approvals in the index protocol assumes the next call such as transfer, invokeTrade etc uses the full amount approve
* [AAVE V3](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/94e571f3a7465201881a59555314cd550ccfda57/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L180-L265) would transfer only the amount owed if it less than parameter amount for repayBorrow.
* `sync` AaveV3LeverageModule is called when DebtIssuanceModule wants to issue or redeem setToken. This would update borrow position by using `_getBorrowPosition` which rounds up unit
* if `borrowedUSDTRaw < totalSupply/1e18`, debt unit would be rounded up to 1
* During redeem, debts are repayed using `notionalDebt` calculated in `componentRedeemHook`
* for `notionalDebt`, `1 unit == _setTokenQuantity/1e18` where _setTokenQuantity is the redeemed amount with fees
* If `notionalDebt > borrowedUSDTRaw`, the whole notionalDebt would not be redeemed by AAVE V3 leaving some allowance from the setToken to the pool. This can be achieved by redeeming more than `borrowedUSDTRaw * 1e18` raw setToken.
* USDT is 6 decimals while setToken is 18 decimals
* USDT would be deployed on ethereum based on this [discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-usdt-to-ethereum-v3-market/11536)


## Vulnerability Detail
Assume, there's this scenario where
* borrowed USDT is 1,000 (raw: 1e9)
* total supply of setToken is 10 billion (raw: 1e10 * 1e18)
* 2 billion is being redeemed (raw: 2e9 * 1e18)

Then, setToken would approve 2,000 USDT to AAVE V3 pool. But only 1,000 would be transferred and another 1,000 would be left in approval.

This affects both `DebtIssuanceModule` and `DebtIssuanceModuleV2`.


## Impact
The smart contract would be locked and it would be impossible to
* redeem setToken cause new approval won't work
* delever cause approval is needed for repay

However, new deposits and token issuance would take place if users don't know about the issue.
