# invokeTransfer could cause fund to be lost for tokens that return false and don't revert

## Summary
invokeTransfer is used in DebtIssuanceModuleV2 on issue and redeem. invokeTransfer uses setToken to invoke `transfer(address,uint256)` method and it doesn't check the returned data. This could be an issue if token returns false for failed transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens return false when transfer or approve fails. They don't revert and it's expected that the caller handles the failure by checking the returned boolean. An example of such token is [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE41d2489571d322189246DaFA5ebDe1F4699F498#code).

## Impact
If transfer fail, the transaction would still be successful and token would be minted or burned. Scenarios that could lead to loss of fund
* user that called issue doesn't get debt token
* user that called redeem doesn't get equity token

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If there's returndata from `_setToken.invoke` in `invokeTransfer` and `invokeApprove`, check that it is true and revert if false. `if (returndata.length > 0) require(abi.decode(returndata, (bool)), "ErrMsg");`
