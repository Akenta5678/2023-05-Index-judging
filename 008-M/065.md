# Functions implementing the `invokeApprove()` of the Invoke Library could revert for non-standard token like USDT

## Summary
When functions implementing the `Invoke.invokeApprove()` attempts to approve non-standard tokens like USDT will revert when a contract or a user tries to approve an allowance when the spender allowance has already been set to a non zero value

## Vulnerability Detail
When functions implementing the `Invoke.invokeApprove()` attempts to approve non-standard tokens like USDT will revert when a contract or a user tries to approve an allowance when the spender allowance has already been set to a non zero value.

In theory, in most of the functions where the invokeApprove() is implemented, after the transfer is completed, the approval is lowered to 0 again.
- However, if the approval is not lowered to exactly 0 (due to a rounding error or another unforeseen situation) then all the next approvals will fail (assuming a token like USDT is used), causing all the functions dependant on `invokeTransfer()` to become unnusable.

## Impact
When functions implementing the `Invoke.invokeApprove()` attempts to approve non-standard tokens like USDT will revert when a contract or a user tries to approve an allowance when the spender allowance has already been set to a non zero value

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- In addition to the described issue, the code is using the direct `approve()` of the ERC20 token, as per [this blog by OpenZeppellin](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/explain-the-practical-use-of-increaseallowance-and-decreaseallowance-functions-on-erc20/15103), the usage of the `approve()` is discouraged, and instead, is recommended to use `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance`.
- Adopt a safer approach to cover edge cases such as the abovementioned USDT token and implement a similar solution as the following:
```solidity
function invokeApprove(
    ISetToken _setToken,
    address _token,
    address _spender,
    uint256 _quantity
)
    internal
{
-   bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSignature("approve(address,uint256)", _spender, _quantity);
-   _setToken.invoke(_token, 0, callData);

+   uint256 allowance = _token.allowance(address(this), address(_setToken));
+   if (allowance > 0) {
+       _token.safeDecreaseAllowance(address(_setToken), allowance);
+   }
+   _token.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(_setToken), amount);
}
```
