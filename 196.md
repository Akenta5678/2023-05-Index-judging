# XO-Invalid Check in PreciseUnitMath.neg Function

## Summary
- The require statement in the `neg` function is always true, because the minimum value of an `int256 is -2**256`. This means that the require statement will never be triggered, and the `neg` function can always be called, even if a is negative. This could allow an attacker to cause the contract to behave in an unexpected way.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/**
     * Returns the negation of a
     */
    function neg(int256 a) internal pure returns (int256) {
        require(a > MIN_INT_256, "Inversion overflow");
        return -a;
    }
}
```
- The vulnerability is in the `require` statement. the condition `a > MIN_INT_256` will always be `true`, because the `minimum` value of an `int256 is -2**256`. this means that the `require` statement will never be `triggered`, and the `neg` function will always be able to be `called`, even if `a` is negative. This could allow an attacker to cause the contract to behave in an unexpected way.
- In the `neg` function, the require statement is intended to ensure that negating a does not result in an overflow, the condition 
`a > MIN_INT_256` is incorrect because `MIN_INT_256` is already the minimum value of an `int256`. As a result, the require statement will always evaluate to true, allowing the negation of a even if it is negative
## Impact
- This vulnerability allow an attacker to cause the contract to behave in an unexpected way.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `require` statement should be changed to `require(a < 0, "Inversion overflow");` this will ensure that the `neg` function can only be called if `a` is negative.
