# Interactions with AMMs do not use deadlines for operations

## Summary
The absence of a deadline check in trading transactions can result in pending transactions

## Vulnerability Detail
The transaction can be pending in mempool for a long and the trading activity is very time senstive. Without deadline check, the trade transaction can be executed in a long time after the user submit the transaction, at that time, the trade can be done in a sub-optimal price, which harms user's position.

The deadline check ensure that the transaction can be executed on time and the expired transaction revert.
## Impact
If the deadline check is absent, the trade transaction may take a considerable amount of time to be executed after the user submits it. During this period, the trade could be completed at a sub-optimal price, resulting in harm to the user's position.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add deadline arguments to all functions that interact with AMMs, and pass it along to AMM calls
