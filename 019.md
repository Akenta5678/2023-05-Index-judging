# external keeper can still call rebalance to lever during disengage process

## Summary
external keeper can still call rebalance during disengage

## Vulnerability Detail
disengage aims to bring down the system leverage to 1x or even completely to 0. The deleverage process also follows the step-wise process to chop trade into `twapMaxTradeSize` size.

However during disengage, external keeper can/could still call rebalance, which would then lever up the system back to the configured targeted leverage. This create friction to the disengagement operation.


## Impact
disengage becomes frictional as off-set by lever action from rebalance.

## Recommendation
add a system checks to pause any rebalance attempt during engagement or disengagement.
