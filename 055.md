# Liquidity providers may lose funds when adding liquidity

## Summary
When adding liquidity there is no protection to prevent that users receive a non-optimal amount of tokens which will end up creating an excess of tokens that won't be redeemable for the amount of LP tokens minted.

## Vulnerability Detail
One of the functionalities in the `AmmModule` contract is to [`addLiquidity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AmmModule.sol#L97-L140) to an AMM pool for a specified AMM.
When adding liquidity to existing Liquidity Pools, all liquidity providers must provide liquidity proportionally to current pool reserves. 
Since a pool is made of two tokens and liquidity is provided in both tokens, there's a possibility for a discrepancy: token amounts may be provided in different proportions. When this happens, [the smaller of the proportions is chosen to calculate the amount of LP tokens minted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/amm/UniswapV2AmmAdapter.sol#L108-L111)
```solidity
uint256 liquidityExpectedFromSuppliedTokens = Math.min(
    maxTokensIn[0].mul(totalSupply).div(reserveA),
    maxTokensIn[1].mul(totalSupply).div(reserveB)
);
```
As a result, the difference in proportions will create an excess of tokens that won't be redeemable for the amount of LP tokens minted. The excess of tokens gets, basically, donated to the pool: it'll be shared among all liquidity providers of the pool.
While the `_minPoolTokenPositionUnit` argument of the [`addLiquidity()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AmmModule.sol#L112) allows liquidity providers to set the minimal amount of LP tokens they want to receive, it doesn't allow them to minimize the disproportion of token amounts or avoid it at all.


## Impact
Liquidity providers may lose a portion of provided liquidity. While the [`_minPoolTokenPositionUnit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AmmModule.sol#L112) protects from slippage when adding liquidity, it doesn't protect from providing liquidity at different K. (x * y = K)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- At some point in the addLiquidity flow, consider calculating optimal token amounts based on the amounts specified by user, current pool reserves, and the minimal LP tokens amount specified by user, and make sure to validate if the `optimalAmount is >= minPoolTokenPositionUnit`. As a reference, consider this code from the Uniswap V2 Router: [UniswapV2Router02.sol#L45-L60](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L45-L60).
