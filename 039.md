# Adress.call{}() should be used instead of address.transfer()

## Summary

address.call{value:x}() should be used instead of address.transfer()

## Vulnerability Detail

Use call instead of transfer to send ether. And return value must be checked if sending ether is successful or not.
Sending ether with the transfer is no longer recommended.

## Impact

When withdrawing and refund ETH, the contract uses Solidity’s transfer() function.

The issues with transfer() are outlined [here](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)

Using Solidity's transfer() function has some notable shortcomings when the withdrawer is a smart contract, which can render ETH deposits impossible to withdraw. Specifically, the withdrawal will inevitably fail when:

The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function.
The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units.
The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the call’s gas usage above 2300.


## Code Snippet

Here msg.sender can be a smart contract then using low-level call.value(amount) with the corresponding result check is recommended
```solidity
    function withdrawEtherBalance() external onlyOperator noRebalanceInProgress {
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance); 
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1221
Here , msg.sender can only be an EAO then using transfer() is ok If you want to allow contract accounts as receivers or want to future-proof your contract, using .call{value: _}("") is better if you check the return value.
```solidity
    function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) internal returns(uint256) {
        uint256 etherToTransfer = _etherReward < address(this).balance ? _etherReward : address(this).balance;

        msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer); 

        return etherToTransfer;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When transferring ETH using low-level call.value(amount) with the corresponding result check or using the OpenZeppelin Address.sendValue is advised, [reference](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L60).
