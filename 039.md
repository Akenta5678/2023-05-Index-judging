# AmmModule will not work with usdt

## Summary
AmmModule will not work with usdt, because it approves amount without reseting approve to 0 before. Because it's possible that amm will trade not whole approved amount, then next approve will fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
`AmmModule.addLiquidity` function allows to provide SetToken components as liquidity into the amm pool.
`_executeAddLiquidity` function [is called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AmmModule.sol#L131) in order to provide liquidity.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AmmModule.sol#L430-L444
```solidity
    function _executeAddLiquidity(ActionInfo memory _actionInfo) internal {
        (
            address targetAmm, uint256 callValue, bytes memory methodData
        ) = _actionInfo.ammAdapter.getProvideLiquidityCalldata(
            address(_actionInfo.setToken),
            _actionInfo.liquidityToken,
            _actionInfo.components,
            _actionInfo.totalNotionalComponents,
            _actionInfo.liquidityQuantity
        );

        _executeComponentApprovals(_actionInfo);

        _actionInfo.setToken.invoke(targetAmm, callValue, methodData);
    }
```
First of all, amm adapter is called with `totalNotionalComponents` array, which is maximum amounts of components that should be added as liquidity. Later, this amounts [will be approved to the amm pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AmmModule.sol#L422-L426). 
The problem is that it's not guaranteed that amm pool will use whole amount that was provided by user. For example uniswap v3 will adjust user's input amounts to mint liquidity.

And in case if usdt is used as token that was not used for the whole approved amount, then next trade will fail as usdt will not provide new approve.
## Impact
Trading with usdt token may fail.

## Recommendation
You can reset approve to 0 before providing new one.
