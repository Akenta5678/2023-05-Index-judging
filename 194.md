# XO-Flawed Collateralization Validation in IssuanceValidationUtils Library

## Summary
- The `validateCollateralizationPostTransferOut` function does not handle the case where the final set supply is `zero`. This could prevent users from redeeming their `tokens` from a `SetToken`, which could lead to financial `loss`.
## Vulnerability Detail
```SOLIDITY
   function validateCollateralizationPostTransferOut(
        ISetToken _setToken, 
        address _component, 
        uint256 _finalSetSupply
    )
        internal 
        view 
    {
        uint256 newComponentBalance = IERC20(_component).balanceOf(address(_setToken));

        uint256 defaultPositionUnit = _setToken.getDefaultPositionRealUnit(address(_component)).toUint256();

        require(
            // Use preciseMulCeil to increase lower bound and maintain over-collateralization
            newComponentBalance >= _finalSetSupply.preciseMulCeil(defaultPositionUnit),
            "Invalid transfer out. Results in undercollateralization"
        );
    }
}

```
- There is a vulnerability is in the line that `requires` the new component` balance` to be greater than or equal to the final set supply multiplied by the default position `unit`. This is not always the case, because the final set supply may be zero. For example, if a user redeems all of the tokens from a `SetToken`, the final set supply will be zero. In this case, the require statement will always fail, which will prevent the user from redeeming their tokens.
## Impact
- It could prevent users from accessing their funds if the `SetToken` is hacked.
- It could prevent users from participating in governance if the `SetToken` is a governance token.
- It could prevent users from earning rewards if the `SetToken` is a yield farming token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `validateCollateralizationPostTransferOut` function could be updated to check if the final set supply is zero. If the final set supply is zero, the function could return without requiring the new component balance to be greater than or equal to the default position unit.
- The `validateCollateralizationPostTransferOut` function could be updated to throw an error if the final set supply is zero. This would prevent users from trying to redeem their tokens if the final set supply is zero.
