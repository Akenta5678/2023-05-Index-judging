# Ether sent to `SetToken` contract will be trapped indefinitely

## Summary

SetToken.sol implements a `receive` function allowing it to receive ether, however there is no way to retrieve ether from the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The presence of a `receive` function in SetToken.sol implies that the contract is expected to receive ether. However in the current implementation all ether sent to the contract, intentionally or not, will be trapped in the contract forever.

## Impact

Loss of ether.

## Code Snippet

```solidity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the contract is intended to be able to receive ether, implement a function to withdraw the contracts ether balance. Otherwise, remove the `receive` function so that should anyone accidentally attempt to send ether to the contract, the call will revert and the ether will not become trapped.
