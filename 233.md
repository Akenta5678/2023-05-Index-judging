# _editPositionMultiplier compounds positionMultiplier

## Summary
fees are streamed linearly across a year. So redeeming once at the end of the year and redeeming every day would result in the same amount of fees accrued. But the positionMultiplier is not linear and rather compounds

## Vulnerability Detail
This table shows how frequency could affect `positionMultiplier` assuming the time between accruals is the same and streamingFeePercentage is 10%

| accrue times  | newMultiplier formula | newMultiplier value   |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1             | 0.9 ^ 1               | 0.9                   |
| 10            | 0.99 ^ 10             | 0.90438               |
| 100           | 0.999 ^ 100           | 0.90479               |
| 1000          | 0.9999 ^ 1000         | 0.90483               |

## Impact
Positions have a slightly higher value than they ought to

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
An imperfect recommendation is to use `int256 newMultiplier = currentMultiplier.sub(_inflationFee.toInt256());` cause positionMultiplier starts from preciseUnit.
