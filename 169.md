# AAVE v3 rewards are not integrated in ClaimModule

## Summary
AAVE v3 has an active reward program where you earn tokens for supplying and borrowing funds: https://docs.aave.com/developers/whats-new/multiple-rewards-and-claim

It's not integrated, meaning a loss of funds for the protocol and its users.

## Vulnerability Detail
Each token & network has its own rewards. On Optimism, you earn OP tokens for example. Because the protocol has a significant amount of TVL, the rewards it earns could grow pretty quickly.

It already implements the necessary structure to collect rewards in the ClaimModule.

What's missing is an integration for AAVE v3. Here's the one for COMP for example: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/claim/CompClaimAdapter.sol

## Impact
Loss of rewards.

## Recommendation
Integrate the AAVE v3 rewards program.
