# No status check for Aave assets after it has been validated once

## Summary

There is no validation check for Aave assets after it has been added to the borrowassets mapping. This can result in unexpected reverts due to the changing status of Aave assets 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function _validateNewBorrowAsset, which is called by the function _addBorrowAssets, validates an Aave asset to be used as collateral shown here:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveV3LeverageModule.sol#L1120-L1130

It checks whether the Aave asset is frozen and active

However, there is no such check whenever the function calls _lever or _validatecommon



Furthermore, the mappings for the status of these Aave assets are not updated in the borrowAssetsEnabled and enabledAssets mappings when the function sync is called shown here:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AaveV3LeverageModule.sol#L437-L454



This can be problematic and lead to unexpected reverts if an Aave admin disables critical functions for that particular Aave asset such as borrowing and depositing.

## Impact

Unexpected reverts if an Aave asset is frozen or not active

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check when borrowing and depositing asset in the validatecommon function, whether an Aave asset is frozen or not.
