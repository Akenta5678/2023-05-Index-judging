# msg.sender == tx.origin does not protect against attacks like sandwich

## Summary
According to the [codebase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/lib/BaseExtension.sol#L56-L62), some functions are restricted to EOA to stop flash loan and sandwich attacks. However, this solution is not thorough for the following reasons
* Sandwich can be done on L1 using tools like flashbots to submit bundles.
* Institutions are trying their hands on MEV, so capital might not be restriction for enticing opportunities that involve sandwich.
* msg.sender == tx.origin does not imply EOA on L2 chains when the transaction is sent from L1
* EOA might not be only address that can start transactions in the future on ethereum because of ongoing discussion and plans on account abstraction.

## Vulnerability Detail


## Impact
The smart contract is attacked from onlyEOA functions such as [rebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L304), [iterateRebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L338), [ripcord](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L376)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make sure the smart contract is resilient no matter the msg.sender or tx.origin.
