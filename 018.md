# ripcord may appear unattractive to external monitory if the ETH reward does not have a lower bound

## Summary
ripcord may appear unattractive to external monitory if the ETH reward does not have a lower bound

## Vulnerability Detail
a call to ripcord would get out reward specified in the incentive configuration, or the remaining balance in the contract, whichever is lower.

However a third-party would be un-tempted to make call to this function since their call to ripcord can be front-runned by the contract owner that transferred out ethereum through `withdrawEtherBalance`. Then they would spend all the gas for nothing.

## Impact
incentives does not work as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
allow the external caller to specify the minimum reward acceptable.
