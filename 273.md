# Transfer function used instead  of Call function to send ether in transferEtherRewardToCaller

## Summary
The transfer function has a gas limit of 2,300 gas, and if the caller is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more than 2,300 gas, the transfer will fail and revert the transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
This limitation can introduce the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if an attacker deliberately constructs a fallback function that consumes more gas than the provided limit, thereby preventing the transfer from completing successfully.
## Impact
This can leave the contract in an inconsistent state and prevent the reward from being successfully transferred to the caller leading to loss of fnds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation 
Use the call function instead of transfer. The call function provides more flexibility and allows specifying a higher gas limit or using a gas stipend to prevent the transfer from failing in scenarios where the caller is a contract with higher gas consumption.

Or or utilize a more robust mechanism for transferring funds, such as the withdrawal pattern, where the recipient explicitly requests the transfer of funds instead of relying on the contract to automatically transfer them.
