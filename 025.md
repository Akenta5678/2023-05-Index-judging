# Precision loss in _calculateStreamingFee to incorrect calculation of the days in a year

## Summary
The function  _calculateStreamingFee uses a constant ONE_YEAR_IN_SECONDS to calculate the streaming fees for a manager. This constant is 365.25 days, which is incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

The constant ONE_YEAR_IN_SECONDS calculates the amount of days in a year which is then used to calculate the amount the streaming fees for a manager. 

 ``` return timeSinceLastFee.mul(_streamingFeePercentage(_setToken)).div(ONE_YEAR_IN_SECONDS);```

The protocol defines this as 365.25 days which is incorrect. This is likely taking the average of days in a year in a 4 year timespan. The amount of days in a year is 365 days and 366 days in a leap year. This means that the streaming fees will be incorrect in any timeframe less than 4 years as it will not be 365.25. This will result in the incorrect streaming fee for a manger.

## Impact

There will be a precision loss for streaming fees due to incorrect calculation of days in a year
